	This paper makes more systematic and deeper studies on numerical simulations of hydraulics and water quality features of river networks. As a result, a series of achievements such as combined cells model of hydraulics, combined cells model of water quality, roughness parameter reverse problem, waste load reverse problem and simulation of hydraulics boundary condition have been put forward for the first time. The details are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] combined cells model of hydraulics.
\item[(2)] combined cells model of water quality.
\end{enumerate}
