TerraClimate uses climatically aided interpolation, combining high-spatial resolution climatological normals from the WorldClim dataset, with coarser resolution time varying (i.e., monthly) data from other sources to produce a monthly dataset of precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, wind speed, vapor pressure, and solar radiation. TerraClimate additionally produces monthly surface water balance datasets using a water balance model that incorporates reference evapotranspiration, precipitation, temperature, and interpolated plant extractable soil water capacity. These data provide important inputs for ecological and hydrological studies at global scales that require high spatial resolution and time varying climate and climatic water balance data. We validated spatiotemporal aspects of TerraClimate using annual temperature, precipitation, and calculated reference evapotranspiration from station data, as well as annual runoff from streamflow gauges. TerraClimate datasets showed noted improvement in overall mean absolute error and increased spatial realism relative to coarser resolution gridded datasets.},

  abstract = {Recharge assessment is of critical importance for groundwater resources evaluation in arid/semiarid areas, as these have typically limited surface water resources. There are several models for water balance evaluation. One of them is WetSpass, which has the ability to simulate spatially distributed recharge, surface runoff, and evapotranspiration for seasonally averaged conditions. This paper presents a modified methodology and model, WetSpass-M, in which the seasonal resolution is downscaled to a monthly scale. A generalized runoff coefficient was introduced, enabling runoff estimation for different land-use classes. WetSpass-M has been calibrated and validated with observed streamflow records from Black Volta. Baseflow from simulated recharge was compared with baseflow derived via a digital filter applied to the observed streamflow and has shown to be in agreement. Previous studies have concluded that for this basin, small changes in rainfall could cause a large change in surface runoff, and here a similar behavior is observed for recharge rates. An advantage of the new model is that it is applicable to medium-and large-sized catchments. It is useful as an assessment tool for evaluating the response of hydrological processes to the changes in associated hydrological variables. Since monthly data for streamflow and climatic variables are widely available, this new model has the potential to be used in regions where data availability at high temporal resolution is an issue. The spatial-temporal characteristics of the model allow distributed quantification of water balance components by taking advantage of remote sensing data.},

  abstract = {River runoff to the Arctic Ocean has increased over the last century, primarily during the winter and spring and primarily from the major Eurasian rivers. Some recent studies have suggested that the additional runoff is due to increased northward transport of atmospheric moisture (and associated increased precipitation), but other studies show inconsistencies in long-term runoff and precipitation trends, perhaps partly due to biases in the observational datasets. Through trend analysis of precipitation, temperature, and streamflow data, the authors investigate the extent to which Eurasian Arctic river discharge changes are attributable to precipitation and temperature changes as well as to reservoir construction and operation between the years of 1936 and 2000. Two new datasets are applied: a gridded precipitation product, in which the low-frequency variability is constrained to match that of long-term bias-corrected precipitation station data, and a reconstructed streamflow product, in which the effects of reservoirs have been minimized using a physically based reservoir model. It is found that reservoir operations have primarily affected streamflow seasonality, increasing winter discharge and decreasing summer discharge. To understand the influences of climate on streamflow changes, the authors hypothesize three cases that would cause precipitation trends to be inconsistent with streamflow trends: first, for the coldest basins in northeastern Siberia, streamflow should be sensitive to warming primarily as a result of the melting of excess ground ice, and for these basins positive streamflow trends may exceed precipitation trends in magnitude; second, evapotranspiration (ET) in the warmer regions of western Siberia and European Russia is sensitive to warming and increased precipitation, therefore observed precipitation trends may exceed streamflow trends; and third, streamflow from the central Siberian basins should respond to both effects. It is found that, in general, these hypotheses hold true. In the coldest basins, streamflow trends diverged from precipitation trends starting in the 1950s to 1960s, and this divergence accelerated thereafter. In the warmest basins, precipitation trends consistently exceeded streamflow trends, suggesting that increased precipitation contributed to increases in both ET and streamflow. In the central basins, permafrost degradation and ET effects appear to be contributing to long-term streamflow trends in varying degrees for each basin. The results herein suggest that the extent and state of the permafrost underlying a basin is a complicating factor in understanding long-term changes in Eurasian Arctic river discharge.},

This complements the daily time series of meteorological forcing and streamflow provided by Newman et al. (2015b). To produce this extension, we synthesized diverse and complementary data sets to describe six main classes of attributes at the catchment scale: topography, climate, streamflow, land cover, soil, and geology. The spatial variations among basins over the CONUS are discussed and compared using a series of maps. The large number of catchments, combined with the diversity of the attributes we extracted, makes this new data set well suited for large-sample studies and comparative hydrology. In comparison to the similar Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) data set, this data set relies on more recent data, it covers a wider range of attributes, and its catchments are more evenly distributed across the CONUS. This study also involves assessments of the limitations of the source data sets used to compute catchment attributes, as well as detailed descriptions of how the attributes were computed. The hydrometeorological time series provided by Newman et al. (2015b, https://doi.org/10.5065/D6MW2F4D) together with the catchment attributes introduced in this paper (https://doi.org/10.5065/D6G73C3Q) constitute the freely available CAMELS data set, which stands for Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies.},

  abstract = {The findings of hydrological modeling studies depend on which model was used. Although hydrological model selection is a crucial step, experience suggests that hydrologists tend to stick to the model they have experience with, and rarely switch to competing models, although these models might be more adequate given the study objectives. To gain quantitative insights into model selection, we explored the use of seven rainfall-runoff models based on the abstract of 1,529 peer-reviewed papers published between 1991 and 2018. The models selected were the Hydrologiska Byr{\aa}ns Vattenbalansavdelning model (HBV), the Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC), the mesoscale Hydrological model (mHM), the TOPography-based hydrologic model (TOPMODEL), the Precipitation Runoff Modelling System (PRMS), the G{\'e}nie Rural model {\`a} 4 param{\`e}tres Journaliers (GR4J), and the Sacramento soil moisture accounting model. We provide quantitative evidence of regional preferences in model use across the world and demonstrate that specific models are consistently preferred by certain institutes. Model attachment is particularly strong. In 74\% of the studies, the model selected can be predicted solely based on the affiliation of the first author. The influence of adequacy on the model selection process is less clear. Our data reveal that each model is used across a wide range of purposes, landscapes, and temporal and spatial scales (i.e., as a model of everything and everywhere). Model intercomparisons can provide guidance for model selection and improve model adequacy, but they are still rare (because each model must usually be setup individually) and the insights they provide are currently limited (because they are rarely controlled experiments). We suggest that moving from fixed-structure models to modular modeling frameworks (master templates for model generation) can overcome these issues, enable a more collaborative and responsive model development environment, and result in improved model adequacy.},

  abstract = {Spatial and temporal variability of streamflow due to climate change affects hydrological processes and irrigation demands at a basin scale. This study investigated the impacts of climate change on the Kurau River in Malaysia using metalearning, an ensemble machine learning technique using support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF) coupled with the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project CMIP6 multi-Global Climate Model (GCM). Five global climate models and three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP12.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5) were used. The climate sequences generated by the delta change factor method were applied as input to the metalearning model to predict the streamflow changes in the Kurau River from 2021 to 2080. The model fitted reasonably well, with Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent bias (PBias), and RMS Error (RMSE) of 0.79, 0.83, 2.52, and 4.51, respectively, for the training period (1976-1995) and 0.72, 0.72, 5.85, and 6.90, respectively, for the testing period (1995-2005). Future projections of multi-GCM over the 2021-2080 period under three SSPs predicted an increase in rainfall for all months except April-June during the dry period (off-season), with a higher increase occurring during the wet period (main season). Temperature projections indicated an increase in maximum and minimum temperatures under all SSP scenarios, with a higher increase of approximately 2.0 degrees C under SSP5-8.5 predicted during the 2051-2080 period relative to the baseline period of 1976-2005. The model predicted that the seasonal changes in streamflow of two planting periods range between -7.5\% and 7.1\% and between 1.2\% and 5.9\% during the off-season and the main season, respectively. A significant streamflow decrease was predicted in April and May for all SSP scenarios due to high temperatures during the off-season, with SSP5-8.5 being the worst. The impact assessment of climate variabilities on the availability of water resources is vital to identify appropriate adaptation strategies to deal with an expected increase in irrigation demand due to global warming in the future. The predicted future streamflow under the potential climate change impacts is crucial for the Bukit Merah Reservoir to establish suitable operational policies for irrigation release.

These changes include corrections to cross-calibration of satellite data inputs and updates to the gauge analysis. Over-ocean changes starting in 2003 resulted in an overall precipitation increase of 1.8\% after 2009. Updating the gauge analysis to its final, high-quality version increases the global land total by 1.8\% for the post-2002 period. These changes correct a small, incorrect dip in the estimated global precipitation over the last decade given by the earlier Version 2.2. The GPCP analysis is also used to describe global precipitation in 2017. The general La Nina pattern for 2017 is noted and the evolution from the early 2016 El Nino pattern is described. The 2017 global value is one of the highest for the 1979-2017 period, exceeded only by 2016 and 1998 (both El Nino years), and reinforces the small positive trend. Results for 2017 also reinforce significant trends in precipitation intensity (on a monthly scale) in the tropics. These results for 2017 indicate the value of the GPCP analysis, in addition to research, for climate monitoring.},

  abstract = {Glaciers of different dimensions respond differently to climate change, resulting in variations in glacier dynamics and runoff. Differentiation of these responses is critical for the Karakoram region (in context to Karakoram anomalies) where glaciers contribute significantly to runoff. Herein, the Open Global Glacier Model is used to quantify these variabilities in the Hunza basin, and thereby develop a comprehensive understanding of how glaciers respond to past and future climate change. Basin glaciers were classified into six classes based on their terminus elevation and area (Z1-Z6). Annual mass balance (MB) time series were reconstructed from 1960 to 2019. The results indicate that the average MB is -0.09 +/- 0.21 m w.e.a- 1, which has been accelerated in 2000 s (average: -0.16 +/- 0.20 m w.e.a- 1). Cumulative MB between classes varies from -4.55 m w.e. (Z1) to -5.92 m w.e. (Z3), indicating that the medium classes (Z3, Z4) glaciers MB is comparatively more negative. Monthly glacier runoff explains the sensitivity of small glaciers to summer temperature, as they only contribute to runoff in the summer season. However, glacier runoff per unit area per year remains almost the same across these groups. Future climate change scenarios under CMIP6 illustrate that small (Z5/Z6) and large (Z1) glaciers will lose up to 90 \% and 10 \% of their volume, area, and length, respectively. The results identified that basin glacier runoff will increase till the year 2060 and will start decreasing after that to 2100. Projected glacier runoff suggests that the Basin runoff is mediated by Z4 glaciers. Whereas, the peak water supply from small size glaciers has occurred in past (Z6) or would occur in near future (Z5) while large size glaciers (Z1-Z3) runoff keeps on increasing till 2100. These findings indicate that immediate mitigation measures are required to deal with glacier change and ensure long-term water security in this region.},

Four U.S. states, including Indiana, New York, Arizona and Georgia area used to represent various level of human activity based on population change and diverse climate conditions. The Mann--Kendall trend analysis is first used to examine the magnitude changes in precipitation, streamflow and potential evapotranspiration for the four states. Four hydrologic modeling methods, including linear regression, hydrologic simulation, annual balance, and Budyko analysis are then used to quantify the amount of climate and human impacts on streamflow. All four methods show that the human impact is higher on streamflow at most gauging stations in all four states compared to climate impact. Among the four methods used, the linear regression approach produced the best hydrologic output in terms of higher Nash--Sutcliffe coefficient. The methodology used in this study is also able to correctly highlight the areas with higher human impact such as the modified channelized reaches in the northwestern part of Indiana. The results from this study show that population alone cannot capture all the changes caused by human activities in a region. However, this approach provides a starting point towards understanding the role of individual human activities on streamflow changes.},

Given this unique context, knowledge concerning how climate change is likely to impact future rainfall characteristics and patterns is critically needed for adaptation and mitigation planning. Using nine ensemble bias-corrected climate model projection results under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (RCP---Representative Concentration Pathway) emissions scenarios at the mid-future time period, 2021/2025--2050 from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiments (CORDEX) dataset; this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the projected changes in rainfall characteristics in three agro-ecological zones of the Niger River Basin. The results show an increase in the average rainfall of about 5\%, 10--20\% and 10--15\% for the Southern Guinea, Northern Guinea and Sahelian zones, respectively, relative to the baseline, 1981/1985--2005. On the other hand, the change in future rainfall intensities are largely significant and the frequency of rainfall at the low, heavy and extreme rainfall events in the future decrease at most locations in the Niger River Basin. The results also showed an increase in the frequency of moderate rainfall events at all locations in the basin. However, in the Northern Guinea and Sahel locations, there is an increase in the frequency of projected heavy and extreme rainfall events. The results reveal a shift in the future onset/cessation and a shortening of the duration of the rainy season in the basin. Specifically, the mean date of rainfall onset will be delayed by between 10 and 32 days. The mean onset of cessation will also be delayed by between 10 and 21 days. It is posited that the projected rainfall changes pose serious risks for food security of the region and may require changes in the cropping patterns and management.},

  abstract = {[1] Coarse soil moisture fields and nonlinear relationships between fluxes and soil moisture combine to yield errors in both diagnostic and predictive estimates of large-scale mass and energy fluxes. Efforts to empirically define the dynamics of subgrid spatial variance of soil moisture have led to contradictory results. Moreover, most reports of soil moisture variability range from qualitative to descriptively quantitative, owing to the lack of a robust theoretical framework for moisture variance dynamics. In this paper we derive a conservation equation for the spatial variance of subgrid root zone soil moisture, based on first principles of statistical fluid mechanics. We arrive at a variance budget in which explicit covariances between moisture fields and land surface flux fields act to produce or destroy variance through time (according to the sign of the correlation between the flux and state fields). A series of examples are used to explore how simple forms of soil, vegetation, precipitation, topography, and initial moisture variability lead to evolving covariances between spatial fields of soil moisture and particular land surface fluxes and how these covariances relate to the temporal trajectory of the spatial variance of soil moisture. We isolate a set of processes and conditions that demonstrate variance production through time and a set that demonstrate variance destruction. Of particular interest is the tendency for transpiration and infiltration-runoff processes to either produce or destroy variance, depending on the background wetness regime. Field data are also employed and shown to demonstrate a temporal behavior of the spatial variance that is readily described by the proposed approach. Ultimately, this work should aid field data interpretation and, when supplemented with a closure model for the variance budget, lead to improved land surface flux predictability over coarse grids.},

  abstract = {Growing interest in global environmental issues has led to the need for global and regional assessment of water resources. A global water assessment model called "WaterGAP 2" is described, which consists of two main components-a Global Water Use model and a Global Hydrology model. These components are used to compute water use and availability on the river basin level. The Global Water Use model consists of (a) domestic and industry sectors which take into account the effect of structural and technological changes on water use, and (b) an agriculture sector which accounts especially for the effect of climate on irrigation water requirements. The Global Hydrology model calculates surface runoff and groundwater recharge based on the computation of daily water balances of the soil and canopy. A water balance is also performed for surface waters, and river flow is routed via a global flow routing scheme. The Global Hydrology model provides a testable method for taking into account the effects of climate and land cover on runoff. The components of the model have been calibrated and tested against data on water use and runoff from river basins throughout the world. Although its performance can and needs to be improved, the WaterGAP 2 model already provides a consistent method to fill in many of the existing gaps in water resources data in many parts of the world. It also provides a coherent approach for generating scenarios of changes in water resources. Hence, it is especially useful as a tool for globally comparing the water situation in river basins.},

First, a statistical detection method is applied to observed (no missing data which represent 42\% of global discharge) and reconstructed (gaps are filled in order to cover a larger area and about 60\% of global discharge) streamflow. Observations show no change over the 1958-1992 period. Further, an extension to 2004 over the same catchment areas using reconstructed data does not provide evidence of a significant change. Conversely, a significant change is found in reconstructed streamflow when a larger area is considered. These results suggest that changes in global streamflow are still unclear. Moreover, changes in streamflow as simulated by models from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) using the historic and future RCP 8.5 scenarios are investigated. Most CMIP5 models are found to simulate the climatological streamflow reasonably well, except for over South America and Africa. Change becomes significant between 2016 and 2040 for all but three models.},

However, observational limitations have hindered a direct evaluation of model-projected changes in extreme precipitation. We used satellite observations and model simulations to examine the response of tropical precipitation events to naturally driven changes in surface temperature and atmospheric moisture content. These observations reveal a distinct link between rainfall extremes and temperature, with heavy rain events increasing during warm periods and decreasing during cold periods. Furthermore, the observed amplification of rainfall extremes is found to be larger than that predicted by models, implying that projections of future changes in rainfall extremes in response to anthropogenic global warming may be underestimated.},

The results are compared to those based on simple autoregressive time series models. The relative performance of the models is dependent on the month of the year in question. The water balance models are most useful for forecasts of April and May flows. For the stations in northern New Jersey, the April and May forecasts were made in order of decreasing reliability using the water-balance-based approaches, using the historical monthly means, and using simple autoregressive models. The water balance models were useful to a lesser extent for forecasts during the fall months. For the rest of the year the improvements in forecasts over those obtained using the simpler autoregressive models were either very small or the simpler models provided better forecasts. When using the water balance models, monthly corrections for bias are found to improve minimum mean-square-error forecasts as well as to improve estimates of the forecast conditional distributions.},

  abstract = {We introduce the first catchment dataset for large sample studies in Chile. This dataset includes 516 catchments; it covers particularly wide latitude (17.8 to 55.0 degrees S) and elevation (0 to 6993 m a.s.l.) ranges, and it relies on multiple data sources (including ground data, remotesensed products and reanalyses) to characterise the hydro-climatic conditions and landscape of a region where in situ measurements are scarce. For each catchment, the dataset provides boundaries, daily streamflow records and basin-averaged daily time series of precipitation (from one national and three global datasets), maximum, minimum and mean temperatures, potential evapotranspiration (PET; from two datasets), and snow water equivalent. We calculated hydro-climatological indices using these time series, and leveraged diverse data sources to extract topographic, geological and land cover features. Relying on publicly available reservoirs and water rights data for the country, we estimated the degree of anthropic intervention within the catchments. To facilitate the use of this dataset and promote common standards in large sample studies, we computed most catchment attributes introduced by Addor et al. (2017) in their Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) dataset, and added several others. We used the dataset presented here (named CAMELS-CL) to characterise regional variations in hydro-climatic conditions over Chile and to explore how basin behaviour is influenced by catchment attributes and water extractions. Further, CAMELS-CL enabled us to analyse biases and uncertainties in basin-wide precipitation and PET. The characterisation of catchment water balances revealed large discrepancies between precipitation products in arid regions and a systematic precipitation underestimation in headwater mountain catchments (high elevations and steep slopes) over humid regions. We evaluated PET products based on ground data and found a fairly good performance of both products in humid regions (r {$>$} 0.91) and lower correlation (r {$<$} 0.76) in hyperarid regions. Further, the satellite-based PET showed a consistent overestimation of observation-based PET. Finally, we explored local anomalies in catchment response by analysing the relationship between hydrological signatures and an attribute characterising the level of anthropic interventions. We showed that larger anthropic interventions are correlated with lower than normal annual flows, runoff ratios, elasticity of runoff with respect to precipitation, and flashiness of runoff, especially in arid catchments. CAMELS-CL provides unprecedented information on catchments in a region largely underrepresented in large sample studies. This effort is part of an international initiative to create multi-national large sample datasets freely available for the community. CAMELS-CL can be visualised from http://camels.cr2.c1 and downloaded from https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.894885.},

Although satellite radar altimetry (RA) has emerged as a popular alternative to measure water levels in inland water bodies, it has not yet been used to understand the large-scale changes in Swedish lakes. Here, we quantify the changes in water levels in 144 lakes using RA data and in situ gauged measurements to examine the effects of flow regulation and hydroclimatic variability. We use data from several RA missions, including ERS-2, ENVISAT, JASON-1,2,3, SARAL, and Sentinel-3A/B. We found that during 1995--2022, around 52\% of the lakes exhibited an increasing trend and 43\% a decreasing trend. Most lakes exhibiting an increasing trend were in the north of Sweden, while most lakes showing a decreasing trend were in the south. Regarding the potential effects of regulation, we found that unregulated lakes had smaller trends in water level and dynamic storage than regulated ones. While the seasonal patterns of water levels in the lakes in the north are similar in regulated and unregulated lakes, in the south, they differ substantially. This study highlights the need to continuously monitor lake water levels for adaptation strategies in the face of climate change and understand the downstream effects of water regulatory schemes.},

  abstract = {Evapotranspiration is a key variable in hydrology, playing an important role in water and energy balance of the land surface. There has been speculation on the direction of trend in potential and actual evapotranspiration (PET and AET) resulting from rising global temperatures, in both observational and derived records representing the historical climate. In this study, PET and AET trends of eight different global model datasets where analyzed over two time periods: from 2003 to 2012 (short term) and from 1980 to 2012 (multidecadal), to identify regions where the trends coincide or differ and to study the reasons behind these changes. The short-term analysis showed considerable uncertainty exists on the detection and direction of significant trends on both PET and AET. There was little agreement among the datasets about the direction of the global trends. The multidecadal study showed much more consistent trends throughout the datasets, particularly in relation to positive significant PET trends. During this period, the global PET mean increased 0.091 mm month-1 yr-1, while the global AET rose at 0.045 mm month-1 yr-1. Much of the opposite PET/AET trends can be attributed to changes in the precipitation. Most of the regions which present these trends are water-limited and present strong correlations between AET and precipitation trends. Some energy-limited regions showed an increasing gap between PET and AET, suggesting the influence of additional variables controlling AET.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in catchment hydrology (such as understanding catchment similarity, accessing new data sources, and refining methods for parameter constraints) make it possible to apply catchment models for ungauged basins over large domains. Here we present a cutting-edge case study applying catchment-modelling techniques with evaluation against river flow at the global scale for the first time. The modelling procedure was challenging but doable, and even the first model version showed better performance than traditional gridded global models of river flow. We used the open-source code of the HYPE model and applied it for \&gt;130\&thinsp;000 catchments (with an average resolution of 1000\&thinsp;km2), delineated to cover the Earth's landmass (except Antarctica). The catchments were characterized using 20 open databases on physiographical variables, to account for spatial and temporal variability of the global freshwater resources, based on exchange with the atmosphere (e.g. precipitation and evapotranspiration) and related budgets in all compartments of the land (e.g. soil, rivers, lakes, glaciers, and floodplains), including water stocks, residence times, and the pathways between various compartments. Global parameter values were estimated using a stepwise approach for groups of parameters regulating specific processes and catchment characteristics in representative gauged catchments. Daily and monthly time series (\&gt;10 years) from 5338 gauges of river flow across the globe were used for model evaluation (half for calibration and half for independent validation), resulting in a median monthly KGE of 0.4. However, the World-Wide HYPE (WWH) model shows large variation in model performance, both between geographical domains and between various flow signatures. The model performs best (KGE\&thinsp;\&gt;0.6) in the eastern USA, Europe, South-East Asia, and Japan, as well as in parts of Russia, Canada, and South America. The model shows overall good potential to capture flow signatures of monthly high flows, spatial variability of high flows, duration of low flows, and constancy of daily flow. Nevertheless, there remains large potential for model improvements, and we suggest both redoing the parameter estimation and reconsidering parts of the model structure for the next WWH version. This first model version clearly indicates challenges in large-scale modelling, usefulness of open data, and current gaps in process understanding. However, we also found that catchment modelling techniques can contribute to advance global hydrological predictions. Setting up a global catchment model has to be a long-term commitment as it demands many iterations; this paper shows a first version, which will be subjected to continuous model refinements in the future. WWH is currently shared with regional/local modellers to appreciate local knowledge.},

The goal of this paper is to distinguish the specific contribution of seasonal snow versus glacier ice melt in the major basins of High Mountain Asia: Ganges, Brahmaputra, Indus, Amu Darya, and Syr Darya. Our methodology involves the application of MODIS-derived remote sensing products to separately calculate daily melt outputs from snow and glacier ice. Using an automated partitioning method, we generate daily maps of (1) snow over glacier ice, (2) exposed glacier ice, and (3) snow over land. These are inputs to a temperature index model that yields melt water volumes contributing to river flow. Results for the five major High Mountain Asia basins show that the western regions are heavily reliant on snow and ice melt sources for summer dry season flow when demand is at a peak, whereas monsoon rainfall dominates runoff during the summer period in the east. While uncertainty remains in the temperature index model applied here, our approach to partitioning melt from seasonal snow and glacier ice is both innovative and systematic and more constrained than previous efforts with similar goals.},

Changes are compared with natural variability, with a significant change being defined as greater than the standard deviation of the hydrological indicator in the absence of climate change. Under an SRES (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) A1b emissions scenario, substantial proportions of the land surface (excluding Greenland and Antarctica) would experience significant changes in hydrological behaviour by 2050; under one climate model scenario (Hadley Centre HadCM3), average annual runoff increases significantly over 47\% of the land surface and decreases over 36\%; only 17\% therefore sees no significant change. There is considerable variability between regions, depending largely on projected changes in precipitation. Uncertainty in projected river flow regimes is dominated by variation in the spatial patterns of climate change between climate models (hydrological model uncertainty is not included). There is, however, a strong degree of consistency in the overall magnitude and direction of change. More than two-thirds of climate models project a significant increase in average annual runoff across almost a quarter of the land surface, and a significant decrease over 14\%, with considerably higher degrees of consistency in some regions. Most climate models project increases in runoff in Canada and high-latitude eastern Europe and Siberia, and decreases in runoff in central Europe, around the Mediterranean, the Mashriq, central America and Brasil. There is some evidence that project change in runoff at the regional scale is not linear with change in global average temperature change. The effects of uncertainty in the rate of future emissions is relatively small. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The model is a daily water balance model, which assumes that the soil moisture storage capacity varies statistically across the catchment: all other catchment properties, and climatic inputs, are assumed constant across the catchment. Model parameters are derived, directly or indirectly, from digital spatial data bases. The model is currently implemented at a spatial resolution of 0.5 x 0.5 degrees (approximately 2000 km(2)), because that is the resolution of the currently available climatic input data. In fact, the article emphasises how the form, parameterisation and quality of simulated output are strongly determined by the quality and characteristics of the data used both to define model parameters and to run the model. The article illustrates the model tuning process-which includes assessment of the input data-using the example of an application in Europe. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Alpine environments are particularly vulnerable to climatic warming, and long term observations suggest a shift of snow-influenced river discharge towards earlier periods of the year. For water resources management, the seasonal patterns of discharge in alpine areas are particularly relevant, as the shift to lower flows in summer and autumn combined with increased water demand could lead to water shortage in downstream catchments. The storage of groundwater in alpine catchments could significantly modulate how changing climatic conditions influence the annual streamflow regime. However, groundwater storage and its buffering capacity in alpine areas remain poorly understood. Moreover, studies on how climate change will impact water resources in alpine areas rarely consider the influence of geology. In this paper, catchment geology is used as a basis for the classification of future summer low flows behavior of several alpine catchments in Switzerland. Based on the analysis of the relationship between low-flow indicators and geology, the role of unconsolidated quaternary deposits is explored. We show that quaternary deposits play a critical role in the seasonal storage of groundwater, which can contribute to rivers during lowflow periods. Three climate change simulations based on extreme RCP 8.5 scenarios are fed into a conceptual hydrological model to illustrate the buffering role of groundwater. Past and future low flows normalized by mean past and future streamflows appear correlated with the percentage of unconsolidated quaternary deposits. These results highlight that catchments with high groundwater contribution to streamflow relative to precipitation will have a slower decrease in future summer discharge. Therefore, we propose two indicators that can be used to anticipate the response of future summers low flows in alpine areas to climate change: the current winter low flows and the percentage of unconsolidated quaternary deposits of the catchments.},

  abstract = {Available energy (often expressed in terms of potential evaporation) and precipitation largely determine annual evapotranspiration and runoff rates in a region. The ratio of annual potential evaporation to precipitation, referred to as the aridity index by Budyko, has been shown to describe the evaporation ratio (the ratio of annual evapotranspiration to precipitation) of catchments from a range of climatic regimes in a number of studies. It has been shown that aridity index alone can be used to obtain an estimate of ratio of standard deviation of annual evapotranspiration estimates to that of precipitation (the evaporation deviation ratio). At present, there are at least five functional forms available, which describe evaporation ratio as a function of aridity index. This study assesses data from Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis' (CCCma) third-generation atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) against these five functional forms. Evaporation ratio and evaporation deviation ratios from an AGCM simulation are compared against these five functional forms and it is shown that the primary control of available energy and precipitation over annual partitioning of precipitation, and interannual variability of evapotranspiration, is preserved well in the AGCM. The aridity index is further used to obtain an analytic equation, which can be used to estimate change in runoff given annual changes in precipitation and available energy. This equation is validated using data from control and climate change simulations of the CCCma coupled GCM (CGCM1) and shown to perform fairly well. The correlation between CGCM1 simulated annual change in runoff and the values obtained using aridity index is consistently around 0.95, and the average bias varies between 40.5 and 50.3mm/year, for the five functional forms. The successful validation of this equation against data from a GCM climate change simulation illustrates the continued relevance of aridity index, and the primary control of precipitation and available energy in determining annual evapotranspiration and runoff rates.},

  abstract = {[1] A systematic approach is described for determining the minimum level of model complexity required to predict runoff in New Zealand catchments, with minimal calibration, at decreasing timescales. Starting with a lumped conceptual model representing the most basic hydrological processes needed to capture water balance, model complexity is systematically increased in response to demonstrated deficiencies in model predictions until acceptable accuracy is achieved. Sensitivity and error analyses are performed to determine the dominant physical controls on streamflow variability. It is found that dry catchments are sensitive to a threshold storage parameter, producing inaccurate results with little confidence, while wet catchments are relatively insensitive, producing more accurate results with more confidence. Sensitivity to the threshold parameter is well correlated with climate and timescale, and in combination with the results of two previous studies, this allowed the postulation of a qualitative relationship between model complexity, timescale, and the climatic dryness index (DI). This relationship can provide an a priori understanding of the model complexity required to accurately predict streamflow with confidence in small catchments under given climate and timescales and a conceptual framework for model selection. The objective of the paper is therefore not to present a perfect model for any of the catchments studied but rather to present a systematic approach to modeling based on making inferences from data that can be applied with respect to different model designs, catchments and timescales.},

We implemented a case study for six river basins across the contiguous United States, with 25 years of meteorological and discharge data. Nine years were reserved for independent validation; two years were used as a warm-up period, one year for each of the calibration and validation periods, respectively; from the remaining 14 years, we sampled increasing amounts of data for model calibration, and found pronounced differences in model performance. While GR4H required less data to converge, LSTM and GRU caught up at a remarkable rate, considering their number of parameters. Also, LSTM and GRU exhibited the higher calibration instability in comparison to GR4H. These findings confirm the potential of modern deep-learning architectures in rainfall-runoff modelling, but also highlight the noticeable differences between them in regard to the effect of calibration data length.},

In this study, twelve monthly water balance models with different structures and various degree of complexity are compared in 153 catchments with different climatic conditions in China. Generally, the GR5M model has the best performance, followed by the GR2M and WBM model. We investigate the relations between model performance and catchment characteristics and find that the climatic characteristic of a catchment is the most important factor impacting model performance. The models have better performance in wet catchments than in dry catchments. Large differences of model performance exist in dry catchments and model users should pay attention to model selection in dry catchments. In addition, we analyze the model performances among different models and conclude that increasing the model complexity does not guarantee a better model performance. Simple models can achieve comparable or even better performance than complex models, For the monthly simulation of hydrological processes, a two-parameter model is sufficient to achieve a good result. Moreover, by comparing the impacts of evapotranspiration simulation and runoff generation simulation on model performance, we find that evapotranspiration simulation has limited influence on the model performance. We suggest model builders focus on runoff generation process rather than evapotranspiration process to improve the performance of a monthly hydrological model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We first address the problem of estimation of the break dates and present an efficient algorithm to obtain global minimizers of the sum of squared residuals. This algorithm is based on the principle of dynamic programming and requires at most least-squares operations of order O(T2) for any number of breaks. Our method can be applied to both pure and partial structural change models. Second, we consider the problem of forming confidence intervals for the break dates under various hypotheses about the structure of the data and the errors across segments. Third, we address the issue of testing for structural changes under very general conditions on the data and the errors. Fourth, we address the issue of estimating the number of breaks. Finally, a few empirical applications are presented to illustrate the usefulness of the procedures. All methods discussed are implemented in a GAUSS program.

  abstract = {At the mean annual scale, water availability of a basin is substantially determined by how much precipitation will be partitioned into evapotranspiration and run-off. The Budyko framework provides a simple but efficient tool to estimate precipitation partitioning at the basin scale. As one form of the Budyko framework, Fu's equation has been widely used to model long-term basin-scale water balance. The major difficulty in applications of Fu's equation is determining how to estimate the curve shape parameter {$\omega$} efficiently. Previous studies have suggested that the parameter {$\omega$} is closely related to the long-term vegetation coverage on large river basins globally. However, on small basins, the parameter {$\omega$} is difficult to estimate due to the diversity of controlling factors. Here, we focused on the estimation of {$\omega$} for small basins in China. We identified the major factors controlling the basin-specific (calibrated) {$\omega$} from nine catchment attributes based on a dataset from 206 small basins ({$\leq$}50,000 km2) across China. Next, we related the calibrated {$\omega$} to the major factors controlling {$\omega$} using two statistical models, that is, the multiple linear regression (MLR) model and artificial neural network (ANN) model. We compared and validated the two statistical models using an independent dataset of 80 small basins. The results indicated that in addition to vegetation, other landscape factors (e.g., topography and human activity) need to be considered to capture the variability of {$\omega$} on small basins better. Contrary to previous findings reached on large basins worldwide, the basin-specific {$\omega$} and remote sensing-based vegetation greenness index exhibit a significant negative correlation. Compared with the default {$\omega$} value of 2.6 used in the Budyko curve method, the two statistical models significantly improved the mean annual ET simulations on validation basins by reducing the root mean square error from 114 mm/year to 74.5 mm/year for the MLR model and 70 mm/year for the ANN model. In comparison, the ANN model can provide a better {$\omega$} estimation than the MLR model.},

  abstract = {Frequent occurrence of flood and ice disasters caused by river channel sedimentation in the Upper Yellow River of China has seriously threatened the lives and property of downstream residents, which has become the most challenging issues in harnessing the Yellow River. In this paper, we aim at optimizing water-sediment regulation that considers two cascade reservoirs (Longyangxia and Liujiaxia) as the regulatory bodies using one multi-objective model (sediment transport and hydropower generation) and two single-objective models (sediment transport only, and hydropower generation only). We propose an innovative approach (FSS-MOPSO) that hybrids the Feasible Search Space (FSS) with the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm to search the optimal solutions for the multi-objective joint operation of cascade reservoirs. We analyze the transformation rules of water-sediment regulation among five objectives (hydropower generation, sediment transport, water supply, flood control and ice control) under various optimization schemes. The results indicate that the conflict between the hydropower generation objective and the sediment transport objective is prominent. An extreme case indicates that an increase in hydropower output by 2.31 billion kWh (17.6\% increase) would greatly reduce the amount of sediment transport (73.5\% decrease) while only makes little effects on the other three objectives. The results demonstrate that the optimal water-sediment regulation not only can ensure to meet water demands in the future (2030) but can provide an important guideline to safely operate cascade reservoirs during ice and flood periods. The research findings contribute to the identification of the relationship among objectives and strategy recommendations on water-sediment regulation for efficient cascade reservoirs operation in the Upper Yellow River.},

In the last several decades, there were statistically significant decreasing trends for streamflow and precipitation, but an increasing trend for mean temperature in the Haihe River Basin (HRB). The attribution of climate variability and human activities for streamflow decrease was quantitatively assessed in three catchments located in different parts of the HRB. They are the Taolinkou catchment in the Luanhe River, Zhangjiafen catchment in the north of Haihe River, and Guantai catchment in the south of Haihe River. Based on the break point of streamflow, the whole period was divided into two periods: "natural period" (before the break point) and "impacted period" (after the break point). Using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model calibrated in the "natural period", the "natural streamflow" without the impact of human activities was reconstructed for the whole period. The differences of the "natural streamflow" between the "natural period" and "impacted period" indicated the impact of climate variability on streamflow decrease. The remaining contribution to streamflow decrease was made by human activities. The results indicated that the decrease of streamflow between the two periods could be attributed to 58.5\% (41.5\%), 40.1\% (59.9\%), and 26.1\% (73.9\%) from climate variability (human activities) in the Taolinkou, Zhangjiafen and Guantai catchment, respectively. That was to say, climate variability was the major driving factor for the streamflow decrease in the Taolinkou catchment; on the other hand, human activities was the main driving factor for the streamflow decrease in the Zhangjiafen and Guantai catchment.

  abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is the headwater of the Yangtze, Yellow, and the transboundary Yarlung Zangbo, Lancang, and Nujiang Rivers, providing essential and pristine freshwater to around 1.6 billion people in Southeast and South Asia. However, the temperature rise TP has experienced is almost three times that of the global warming rate. The rising temperature has resulted in glacier retreat, snow cover reduction, permafrost layer thawing, and so forth. Here we show, based on the longest observed streamflow data available for the region so far, that changing climatic conditions in the TP already had significant impacts on the streamflow in the headwater basins in the area. Our analysis indicated that the annual average temperature in the headwater basins of these five major rivers has been rising on a trend averaging 0.38~{$^\circ$}C{$\cdot$}decade-1 since 1998, almost triple the rate before 1998, and the change of streamflow has been predominantly impacted by precipitation in these headwater basins. As a result, streamflow in the Yangtze, Yarlung Zangbo, Lancang, and Nujiang River headwater areas is on a decreasing trend with a reduction of flow ranging from 3.0 {\texttimes}109--5.9 {\texttimes}109 m3{$\cdot$}decade-1 (-9.12\% to -16.89\% per decade) since 1998. The increased precipitation in the Tangnahai (TNH) and Lanzhou (LZ) Basins contributed to the increase of their streamflows at 8.04\% and 14.29\% per decade, respectively. Although the increased streamflow in the headwater basins of the Yellow River may ease some of the water resources concerns, the decreasing trend of streamflow in the headwater areas of the southeastern TP region since 1998 could lead to a water crisis in transboundary river basins for billions of people in Southeast and South Asia.},

This study uses more than 3000 high-quality, independent rawinsondes at 11 stations (which were not assimilated in any of the reanalyses), which represents the first time that such a comprehensive evaluation is performed to assess the quality of these four most widely used reanalysis products over this region, which is highest in the world and crucial to the global climate and weather. Averaging over the entire three-month period, it is found that each reanalysis dataset produces mean values of temperature and horizontal winds consistent with the verifying soundings (indicating relatively small mean bias); however, there are considerable differences (biases) in the mean relative humidity. On average, except for temperature at higher levels, both newer-generation reanalyses (CFSR and ERA-Interim) have smaller root-mean-square (RMS) error and bias than their predecessors (NCEP-NCAR and ERA-40). With some exceptions, the RMS errors of all variables for both CFSR and ERA-Interim(verifying with soundings) are similar in magnitude to the RMS difference between these two reanalyses, all of which are approximately twice as large as the corresponding observation errors. It is also found that there are strong diurnal variations in both RMS error and mean bias that differ greatly among different reanalyses and at different pressure levels.},

  abstract = {Climate variability and land use/cover change have a significant impact on hydrological regimes, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, which have critical water shortage problems. Using the Mann-Kendall's test methodology, trends in hydro-climatic variables -- including precipitation, temperature, land use, and water balance indicators -- have been detected during the last 60 years in the Middle Yellow River Basin (MYRB). Generally, the MYRB has become much warmer and drier. Compared with 1980, the land use has also changed -- to a small degree by 2000 and to a significant degree by 2015, with an increase in vegetation coverage. There are decreasing trends for streamflow and water resources and a shift in water balance, with less precipitation generating streamflow and more water being evaporated, especially after 2000. The response of water balance to climate change and land use/cover change, and the attribution for streamflow decrease was analyzed in the 10 sub-regions of the MYRB, based on the regionalization of parameter w of Fu's Formula. The results indicate that with an increase of E0/P (potential evaporation/precipitation) or w, there is an increase of ET/P (evapotranspiration/precipitation) and a decrease of R/P (streamflow/precipitation). But, the increasing rate of ET/P decreases with an increase of E0/P or w. Based on the ``natural period'' streamflow of 1956--1979, climate variability accounts for 75.8\% of streamflow decrease in 1980--2000. But in 2001--2016, land use/cover change is the main factor in streamflow decrease, accounting for 75.5\% of the decline. The results are useful for understanding what has happened and what will happen under climate change and land use/cover change, for adaption to future water resources management.},

  abstract = {As a critical factor of earth's ecosystem, vegetation is sensitive to climate change and its feedback has a pro\- nounced effect on climate, hydrology, and ecology, etc. The quantitative sensitivity of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to climate change has been investigated in the Yellow-Huai-Hai River Basin (YHHRB) covering multiple climatic zones. Based on multicollinearity test using the Variance Inflation Factor, four cli\- matic factors and six landuse types were used as independent variables for NDVI simulation. The calibrated and validated statistical vegetation models denoted good performance using four machine learning algorithms. The ensemble results from the four machine learning modelling were used to assess the sensitivity of NDVI to temperature and precipitation change on annual and monthly scale. Based on historical climatic variability and future scenarios, eight hypothetical climatic scenarios for the changes in temperature and precipitation were used in this study. The results indicated that there were positive responses of NDVI to temperature and pre\- cipitation change. As an one {\textopenbullet}C increase in temperature, the NDVI was going to increase by 3.03\%--5.79\%, and it would increase by 3.35\%--4.80\% when the precipitation increased 10\% in the YHHRB. Relatively, the NDVI was more sensitive to precipitation decrease than increase. The sensitivity of NDVI to temperature or precipitation was non-linear as temperature or precipitation changing for a specified climatic zone. Monthly, the sensitivity of NDVI to temperature change varied among the four climatic zones, but as precipitation increasing, the higher and lower sensitivity of NDVI were investigated in wetter and drier months, respectively. Spatially, the NDVI was more sensitive to temperature and precipitation in colder and drier areas, respectively. Landuse also has a sig\- nificant impact on the sensitivity of NDVI to climate change. The results might be useful for understanding the climate-vegetation dynamics and landuse management under future climate change.},

We mapped streamflow by means of artificial neural networks (ANNs) regression. An ensemble of ANNs were fitted on monthly streamflow observations from 6600 monitoring stations worldwide, i.e., minimum and maximum annual flows represent the lowest and highest mean monthly flows for a given year. As covariates we used the upstream-catchment physiography (area, surface slope, elevation) and year-specific climatic variables (precipitation, temperature, potential evapotranspiration, aridity index and seasonality indices). Confronting the maps with independent data indicated good agreement (R-2 values up to 91\%).

  abstract = {A methodology for automated objective circulation pattern (CP) definition and classification is presented based on optimized fuzzy rules. The main goal of the method is to provide a basis (daily classified CPs) for downscaling of precipitation and temperature, which can be done by means of downscaling models with parameters depending on the CP. The CPs are defined using 500 or 700 hPa geopotential height anomalies. Fuzzy rules are defined by the position of high- and low-pressure anomalies. The fuzzy rules are obtained automatically using an optimization of the performance of the classification. For precipitation, the performance of the classification is measured by rainfall frequencies and rainfall amounts conditioned on the CP. So the task is to define wet or dry CPs. For temperature, the deviation from the average long-term annual cycle is used. In this way warm or cold CPs are identified. The performance of the CPs is validated using a split-sampling approach. The presented method produces physically realistic CP definitions. With the help of these definitions the observed (historical) pressure fields can be classified as shown in 2 case studies for regions with different climate conditions: Central Europe (Germany) and the Eastern Mediterranean (Greece).},

This trend is systematic in the southeast Amazon but driven by episodic droughts (2005, 2010, 2015) in the northwest, with the highest recoded VPD since 1979 for the 2015 drought. The univariant detection analysis shows that the observed increase in VPD cannot be explained by greenhouse-gas-induced (GHG) radiative warming alone. The bivariate attribution analysis demonstrates that forcing by elevated GHG levels and biomass burning aerosols are attributed as key causes for the observed VPD increase. We further show that~There is a negative trend in evaporative fraction in the southeast Amazon, where lack of atmospheric moisture, reduced precipitation together with higher incoming solar radiation ({\textasciitilde}7\% decade               -1               cloud-cover reduction) influences the partitioning of surface energy fluxes towards less evapotranspiration. The VPD increase combined with the decrease in evaporative fraction are the first indications of positive climate feedback mechanisms, which we show that will continue and intensify in the course of unfolding anthropogenic climate change.},

  abstract = {All currently available climate models predict a near-surface warming trend under the influence of rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In addition to the direct effects on climate---for example, on the frequency of heatwaves---this increase in surface temperatures has important consequences for the hydrological cycle, particularly in regions where water supply is currently dominated by melting snow or ice. In a warmer world, less winter precipitation falls as snow and the melting of winter snow occurs earlier in spring. Even without any changes in precipitation intensity, both of these effects lead to a shift in peak river runoff to winter and early spring, away from summer and autumn when demand is highest. Where storage capacities are not sufficient, much of the winter runoff will immediately be lost to the oceans. With more than one-sixth of the Earth's population relying on glaciers and seasonal snow packs for their water supply, the consequences of these hydrological changes for future water availability---predicted with high confidence and already diagnosed in some regions---are likely to be severe.},

The models were all driven by the WATCH Forcing Data ERA-Interim (WFDEI) meteorological dataset, but used different datasets for non-meteorologic inputs and were run at various spatial and temporal resolutions, although all data were re-sampled to a common 0.5 degrees spatial and daily temporal resolution. For the evaluation, we used a broad range of performance metrics related to important aspects of the hydrograph. We found pronounced inter-model performance differences, underscoring the importance of hydrological model uncertainty in addition to climate input uncertainty, for example in studies assessing the hydrological impacts of climate change. The uncalibrated GHMs were found to perform, on average, better than the uncalibrated LSMs in snow-dominated regions, while the ensemble mean was found to perform only slightly worse than the best (calibrated) model. The inclusion of less-accurate models did not appreciably degrade the ensemble performance. Overall, we argue that more effort should be devoted on calibrating and regionalizing the parameters of macro-scale models. We further found that, despite adjustments using gauge observations, the WFDEI precipitation data still contain substantial biases that propagate into the simulated runoff. The early bias in the spring snowmelt peak exhibited by most models is probably primarily due to the widespread precipitation underestimation at high northern latitudes.},

Here we present a novel parameter regionalization approach that involves the optimization of transfer equations linking model parameters to climate and landscape characteristics. The optimization was performed in a fully spatially distributed fashion at high resolution (0.05 degrees), instead of at lumped catchment scale, using an unprecedented database of daily observed streamflow from 4,229 headwater catchments ({$<$}5,000 km(2)) worldwide. The optimized equations were subsequently applied globally to produce parameter maps for the entire land surface including ungauged regions. The approach was evaluated using the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) and a gridded version of the hydrological model HBV. Tenfold cross validation was used to evaluate the generalizability of the approach and to obtain an ensemble of parameter maps. For the 4,229 independent validation catchments, the regionalized parameters yielded a median KGE of 0.46. The median KGE improvement (relative to uncalibrated parameters) was 0.29, and improvements were obtained for 88\% of the independent validation catchments. These scores compare favorably to those from previous large catchment sample studies. The degree of performance improvement due to the regionalized parameters did not depend on climate or topography. Substantial improvements were obtained even for independent validation catchments located far from the catchments used for optimization, underscoring the value of the derived parameters for poorly gauged regions. The regionalized parameters-available via -should be useful for hydrological applications requiring accurate streamflow simulations.},

Observed Q from 3000 to 4000 small-to-medium-sized catchments (10-10 000 km(2)) around the globe were used to train neural network ensembles to estimate Q characteristics based on climate and physiographic characteristics of the catchments. In total, 17 Q characteristics were selected, including mean annual Q, baseflow index, and a number of flow percentiles. Testing coefficients of determination for the estimation of the Q characteristics ranged from 0.55 for the baseflow recession constant to 0.93 for the Q timing. Overall, climate indices dominated among the predictors. Predictors related to soils and geology were relatively unimportant, perhaps because of their data quality. The trained neural network ensembles were subsequently applied spatially over the entire ice-free land surface, resulting in global maps of the Q characteristics (at 0.125 degrees resolution). These maps possess several unique features: they represent observation-driven estimates, they are based on an unprecedentedly large set of catchments, and they have associated uncertainty estimates. The maps can be used for various hydrological applications, including the diagnosis of macroscale hydrological models. To demonstrate this, the produced maps were compared to equivalent maps derived from the simulated daily Q of four macroscale hydrological models, highlighting various opportunities for improvement in model Q behavior.},

However, these studies generally used streamflow observations from a relatively small number of catchments ({$<$}200) located in small, homogeneous study areas, which may have led to less reliable models with limited applicability elsewhere. Here, we use streamflow observations from a highly heterogeneous set of 3394 catchments ({$<$}10,000 km(2)) worldwide to construct reliable, widely applicable models based on 18 climatic and physiographic characteristics to estimate two important base flow characteristics: (1) the base flow index (BFI), defined as the ratio of long-term mean base flow to total streamflow; and (2) the base flow recession constant (k), defined as the rate of base flow decay. Regression analysis results revealed that BFI and k were related to several climatic and physiographic characteristics, notably mean annual potential evaporation, mean snow water equivalent depth, and abundance of surface water bodies. Ensembles of artificial neural networks (ANNs; obtained by subsampling the original set of catchments) were trained to estimate the base flow characteristics from climatic and physiographic data. The catchment-scale estimation of the base flow characteristics demonstrated encouraging performance with R-2 values of 0.82 for BFI and 0.72 for k. The connection weights of the trained ANNs indicated that climatic characteristics were more important for estimating k than BFI. Global maps of estimated BFI and k were obtained using global climatic and physiographic data as input to the derived models. The resulting global maps are available for free download at http://www.hydrology-amsterdam.nl.},

  abstract = {Current state-of-the-art models typically applied at continental to global scales (hereafter called macroscale) tend to use a priori parameters, resulting in suboptimal streamflow (Q) simulation. For the first time, a scheme for regionalization of model parameters at the global scale was developed. We used data from a diverse set of 1787 small-to-medium sized catchments ( 10-10,000 km(2)) and the simple conceptual HBV model to set up and test the scheme. Each catchment was calibrated against observed daily Q, after which 674 catchments with high calibration and validation scores, and thus presumably good-quality observed Q and forcing data, were selected to serve as donor catchments. The calibrated parameter sets for the donors were subsequently transferred to 0.5 degrees grid cells with similar climatic and physiographic characteristics, resulting in parameter maps for HBV with global coverage. For each grid cell, we used the 10 most similar donor catchments, rather than the single most similar donor, and averaged the resulting simulated Q, which enhanced model performance. The 1113 catchments not used as donors were used to independently evaluate the scheme. The regionalized parameters outperformed spatially uniform (i.e., averaged calibrated) parameters for 79\% of the evaluation catchments. Substantial improvements were evident for all major Koppen-Geiger climate types and even for evaluation catchments{$>$}5000 km distant from the donors. The median improvement was about half of the performance increase achieved through calibration. HBV with regionalized parameters outperformed nine state-of-the-art macroscale models, suggesting these might also benefit from the new regionalization scheme. The produced HBV parameter maps including ancillary data are available via .},

The future map is derived from an ensemble of 32 climate model projections (scenario RCP8.5), by superimposing the projected climate change anomaly on the baseline high-resolution climatic maps. For both time periods we calculate confidence levels from the ensemble spread, providing valuable indications of the reliability of the classifications. The new maps exhibit a higher classification accuracy and substantially more detail than previous maps, particularly in regions with sharp spatial or elevation gradients.

  abstract = {Sustainable groundwater use relies on adequate rates of groundwater recharge, which are expected to change with climate change. However, climate impacts on recharge remain uncertain due to a paucity of measurements of recharge trends globally. Here we leverage the relationship between climatic aridity and long-term recharge measurements at 5,237 locations globally to identify regions where recharge is most sensitive to changes in climatic aridity. Recharge is most sensitive to climate changes in regions where potential evapotranspiration slightly exceeds precipitation, meaning even modest aridification can substantially decrease groundwater recharge. Future climate-induced recharge changes are expected to be dominated by precipitation changes, whereby changes in groundwater recharge will be amplified relative to precipitation changes. Recharge is more sensitive to changes in aridity than global hydrological models suggest. Consequently, the effects of climatic changes on groundwater replenishment and their impacts on the sustainability of groundwater use by humans and ecosystems probably exceed previous predictions.},

  abstract = {In a warming climate, precipitation is less likely to occur as snowfall(1,2). A shift from a snow-towards a rain-dominated regime is currently assumed not to influence the mean stream-flow significantly(1,3-5). Contradicting the current paradigm, we argue that mean streamflow is likely to reduce for catchments that experience significant reductions in the fraction of precipitation falling as snow. With more than one-sixth of the Earth's population depending on meltwater for their water supply(3) and ecosystems that can be sensitive to streamflow alterations(6), the socio-economic consequences of a reduction in streamflow can be substantial. By applying the Budyko water balance framework(7) to catchments located throughout the contiguous United States we demonstrate that a higher fraction of precipitation falling as snow is associated with higher mean streamflow, compared to catchments with marginal or no snowfall. Furthermore, we show that the fraction of each year's precipitation falling as snowfall has a significant influence on the annual streamflow within individual catchments. This study is limited to introducing these observations; process-based understanding at the catchment scale is not yet provided. Given the importance of streamflow for society, further studies are required to respond to the consequences of a temperature-induced precipitation shift from snow to rain.},

Here, we provide an assessment of changes in the largest flood events (similar to 0.033 annual exceedance probability) observed during the period 1980-2009 for 1744 catchments located in Australia, Brazil, Europe and the United States. The occurrence of rare floods in spatial aggregate shows strong temporal variability and peaked around 1995. During the 30 year period, there are overall increases in both the frequency and magnitude of extreme floods. These increases are strongest in Europe and the United States, and weakest in Brazil and Australia. Physical causes of the reported short-term variability and longer-term changes in extreme floods currently remain elusive, because the key drivers vary between catchments.

Here, abrupt changes in ecosystem functioning [so-called turning points (TPs)] were detected using time series of Earth observation data. Hotspot areas of high TP occurrence were identified, observed changes characterized and insights gained on potential drivers for these changes. Location Arid and semi-arid regions. Time period 1982-2015. Methods We used a time series segmentation technique (breaks for additive season and trend) to detect breakpoints in rain-use efficiency as a means of analysing changes in ecosystem functioning. A new typology to characterize the detected changes was proposed and evaluated, at regional to local scales, for a set of case studies. Ancillary data on population and drought were used to provide insights on potential drivers of TP occurrence. Results Turning points in ecosystem functioning were found in 13.6\% (c. 2.1 x 10(6) km(2)) of global drylands. Turning point hotspots were primarily observed in North America, the Sahel, Central Asia and Australia. In North America, the majority of TPs (62.6\%) were characterized by a decreasing trend in ecosystem functioning, whereas for the other regions, a positive reversal in ecosystem functioning was prevalent. Further analysis showed that: (a) both climatic and anthropogenic pressure influenced the occurrence of TPs in North America; (b) Sahelian grasslands were primarily characterized by drought-induced TPs; and (c) high anthropogenic pressure coincided with the occurrence of TPs in Asia and Australia. Main conclusions By developing a new typology targeting the categorization of abrupt and gradual changes in ecosystem functioning, we detected and characterized TPs in global drylands. This TP characterization is a first crucial step towards understanding the drivers of change and supporting better decision-making for ecosystem conservation and management in drylands.},

  abstract = {It may be endemic to mechanistic modelling of complex environmental systems that there are many different model structures and many different parameter sets within a chosen model structure that may be behavioural or acceptable in reproducing the observed behaviour of that system. This has been called the equi{\textregistered}nality concept. The generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodology for model identi{\textregistered}cation allowing for equi{\textregistered}nality is described. Prediction within this methodology is a process of ensemble forecasting using a sample of parameter sets from the behavioural model space, with each sample weighted according to its likelihood measure to estimate prediction quantiles. This allows that different models may contribute to the ensemble prediction interval at different time steps and that the distributional form of the predictions may change over time. Any effects of model nonlinearity, covariation of parameter values and errors in model structure, input data or observed variables, with which the simulations are compared, are handled implicitly within this procedure. GLUE involves a number of choices that must be made explicit and can be therefore subjected to scrutiny and discussion. These include ways of combining information from different types of model evaluation or from different periods in a data assimilation context. An example application to rainfall-runoff modelling is used to illustrate the methodology, including the updating of likelihood measures. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The influence of climate change on the regional hydrological cycle has been an international scientific issue that has attracted more attention in recent decades due to its huge effects on drought and flood. It is essential to investigate the change of regional hydrological characteristics in the context of global warming for developing flood mitigation and water utilization strategies in the future. The purpose of this study is to carry out a comprehensive analysis of changes in future runoff and flood for the upper Huai River basin by combining future climate scenarios, hydrological model, and flood frequency analysis. The daily bias correction (DBC) statistical downscaling method is used to downscale the global climate model (GCM) outputs from the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and to generate future daily temperature and precipitation series. The Xinanjiang (XAJ) hydrological model is driven to project changes in future seasonal runoff under SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios for two future periods: 2050s (2031-2060) and 2080s (2071-2100) based on model calibration and validation. Finally, the peaks over threshold (POT) method and generalized Pareto (GP) distribution are combined to evaluate the changes of flood frequency for the upper Huai River basin. The results show that 1) GCMs project that there has been an insignificant increasing trend in future precipitation series, while an obvious increasing trend is detected in future temperature series; 2) average monthly runoffs in low-flow season have seen decreasing trends under SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios during the 2050s, while there has been an obvious increasing trend of average monthly runoff in high-flow season during the 2080s; 3) there is a decreasing trend in design floods below the 50-year return period under two future scenarios during the 2050s, while there has been an significant increasing trend in design flood during the 2080s in most cases and the amplitude of increase becomes larger for a larger return period. The study suggests that future flood will probably occur more frequently and an urgent need to develop appropriate adaptation measures to increase social resilience to warming climate over the upper Huai River basin.},

The results showed that: (1) the predominant patterns of land-use change in the QRB included the transformations from paddy fields to urban areas and dry lands, forest to dry lands and dry lands to urban areas; (2) the flood seasonal precipitation series and all air temperature series had significant increasing trends over 1986--2015, and annual and seasonal runoff series had significant increasing trends and had an abrupt change point in 2001; (3) the average annual, flood seasonal, and non-flood seasonal runoff increased 238.5, 130.2 and 108.3 mm, of which land-use change was responsible for 77.6, 55.1, and 104.8\% of the increases, respectively, while climate change was responsible for 22.4, 44.9, and {\`A}4.8\%, respectively and (4) the hydrological response to land-use change showed an obvious decrease in actual evapotranspiration (ET) and significant increases in surface runoff and baseflow. The decrease of ET and increase of baseflow could be attributed to the conversion patterns from paddy fields and forest to dry lands, while the conversions from paddy fields and dry lands to urban areas caused a remarkable increase in surface runoff in the QRB. The study demonstrated that these practicable approaches were beneficial for the more unbiased views of the hydrological responses to climate change and land-use changes in the highly urbanized basin, which were also critical for the sustainable development of regional water resource and future landuse planning.},

Seven global gridded precipitation datasets are compared at river basin scale in terms of mean annual and seasonal precipitation. The representation of seasonality is similar in all datasets, but the uncertainty in mean annual precipitation is large, especially in mountainous, arctic, and small basins. The average precipitation uncertainty in a basin is 30\%, but there are strong differences between basins. The effect of this precipitation uncertainty on mean annual and seasonal discharge was assessed using the uncalibrated dynamic global vegetation and hydrology model Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed land (LPJmL), yielding even larger uncertainties in discharge (average 90\%). For 95 basins (out of 213 basins for which measurements were available) calibration of model parameters is problematic because the observed discharge falls within the uncertainty of the simulated discharge. A method is presented to account for precipitation uncertainty in discharge simulations.},

Yet to date, no globally consistent assessment of permafrost temperature change has been compiled. Here we use a global data set of permafrost temperature time series from the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost to evaluate temperature change across permafrost regions for the period since the International Polar Year (2007-2009). During the reference decade between 2007 and 2016, ground temperature near the depth of zero annual amplitude in the continuous permafrost zone increased by 0.39 +/- 0.15 degrees C. Over the same period, discontinuous permafrost warmed by 0.20 +/- 0.10 degrees C. Permafrost in mountains warmed by 0.19 +/- 0.05 degrees C and in Antarctica by 0.37 +/- 0.10 degrees C. Globally, permafrost temperature increased by 0.29 +/- 0.12 degrees C. The observed trend follows the Arctic amplification of air temperature increase in the Northern Hemisphere. In the discontinuous zone, however, ground warming occurred due to increased snow thickness while air temperature remained statistically unchanged.},

The Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test, a global-sensitivity algorithm, was implemented on a MWBM to generate parameter sensitivities on a set of 109 951 hydrologic response units (HRUs) across the CONUS. The HRUs were grouped into 110 calibration regions based on similar parameter sensitivities. Subsequently, measured runoff from 1575 streamgages within the calibration regions were used to calibrate the MWBM parameters to produce parameter sets for each calibration region. Measured and simulated runoff at the 1575 streamgages showed good correspondence for the majority of the CONUS, with a median computed Nash--Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0.76 over all streamgages. These methods maximize the use of available runoff information, resulting in a calibrated CONUS-wide application of the MWBM suitable for providing estimates of water availability at the HRU resolution for both gaged and ungaged areas of the CONUS.},

  abstract = {In order to better assess the role of agriculture within the global climate-vegetation system, we present a model of the managed planetary land surface, Lund--Potsdam--Jena managed Land (LPJmL), which simulates biophysical and biogeochemical processes as well as productivity and yield of the most important crops worldwide, using a concept of crop functional types (CFTs). Based on the LPJ-Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, LPJmL simulates the transient changes in carbon and water cycles due to land use, the specific phenology and seasonal CO2 fluxes of agricultural-dominated areas, and the production of crops and grazing land. It uses 13 CFTs (11 arable crops and two managed grass types), with specific parameterizations of phenology connected to leaf area development. Carbon is allocated daily towards four carbon pools, one being the yield-bearing storage organs. Management (irrigation, treatment of residues, intercropping) can be considered in order to capture their effect on productivity, on soil organic carbon and on carbon extracted from the ecosystem. For transient simulations for the 20th century, a global historical land use data set was developed, providing the annual cover fraction of the 13 CFTs, rain-fed and/or irrigated, within 0.5{$^\circ$} grid cells for the period 1901--2000, using published data on land use, crop distributions and irrigated areas. Several key results are compared with observations. The simulated spatial distribution of sowing dates for temperate cereals is comparable with the reported crop calendars. The simulated seasonal canopy development agrees better with satellite observations when actual cropland distribution is taken into account. Simulated yields for temperate cereals and maize compare well with FAO statistics. Monthly carbon fluxes measured at three agricultural sites also compare well with simulations. Global simulations indicate a {$\sim$}24\% (respectively {$\sim$}10\%) reduction in global vegetation (respectively soil) carbon due to agriculture, and 6--9 Pg C of yearly harvested biomass in the 1990s. In contrast to simulations of the potential natural vegetation showing the land biosphere to be an increasing carbon sink during the 20th century, LPJmL simulates a net carbon source until the 1970s (due to land use), and a small sink (mostly due to changing climate and CO2) after 1970. This is comparable with earlier LPJ simulations using a more simple land use scheme, and within the uncertainty range of estimates in the 1980s and 1990s. The fluxes attributed to land use change compare well with Houghton's estimates on the land use related fluxes until the 1970s, but then they begin to diverge, probably due to the different rates of deforestation considered. The simulated impacts of agriculture on the global water cycle for the 1990s are{$\sim$}5\% (respectively{$\sim$}20\%) reduction in transpiration (respectively interception), and{$\sim$}44\% increase in evaporation. Global runoff, which includes a simple irrigation scheme, is practically not affected.},

This study uses simulations performed with coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) to investigate how regional precipitation in the twenty-first century may be affected by changes in both ENSO-driven precipitation variability and slowly evolving mean rainfall. First, a dominant, time-invariant pattern of canonical ENSO variability (cENSO) is identified in observed SST data. Next, the fidelity with which 33 state-of-the-art CGCMs represent the spatial structure and temporal variability of this pattern (as well as its associated precipitation responses) is evaluated in simulations of twentieth-century climate change. Possible changes in both the temporal variability of this pattern and its associated precipitation teleconnections are investigated in twenty-first-century climate projections. Models with better representation of the observed structure of the cENSO pattern produce winter rainfall teleconnection patterns that are in better accord with twentieth-century observations and more stationary during the twenty-first century. Finally, the model-predicted twenty-first-century rainfall response to cENSO is decomposed into the sum of three terms: 1) the twenty-first-century change in the mean state of precipitation, 2) the historical precipitation response to the cENSO pattern, and 3) a future enhancement in the rainfall response to cENSO, which amplifies rainfall extremes. By examining the three terms jointly, this conceptual framework allows the identification of regions likely to experience future rainfall anomalies that are without precedent in the current climate.},

  abstract = {The hydrological budget of Himalayan rivers is dominated by monsoonal rainfall and snowmelt, but their relative impact is not well established because this remote region lacks a dense gauge network. Here, we use a combination of validated remotely-sensed climate parameters to characterize the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall, snowfall, and evapotranspiration in order to quantify their relative contribution to mean river discharge. Rainfall amounts are calculated from calibrated, orbital, high-resolution Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission data, and snow-water equivalents are computed from a snowmelt model based on satellite-derived snow cover, surface temperature, and solar radiation. Our data allow us to identify three key aspects of the spatiotemporal precipitation pattern. First, we observe a strong decoupling between the rainfall on the Himalayan foreland versus that in the mountains: a pronounced sixfold, east-west rainfall gradient in the Ganges plains exists only at elevations {$<$}500 m asl. Mountainous regions (500 to 5000 m asl) receive nearly equal rainfall amounts along strike. Second, whereas the Indian summer monsoon is responsible for more than 80\% of annual rainfall in the central Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau, the eastern and western syntaxes receive only similar to 50\% of their annual rainfall during the summer season. Third, snowmelt contributions to discharge differ widely along the range. As a fraction of the total annual discharge, snowmelt constitutes up to 50\% in the far western (Indus area) catchments, similar to 25\% in far eastern (Tsangpo) catchments, and {$<$}20\% elsewhere. Despite these along-strike variations, snowmelt in the pre- and early-monsoon season (April to June) is significant and important in all catchments, although most pronounced in the western catchments. Thus, changes in the timing or amount of snowmelt due to increasing temperatures or decreasing winter precipitation may have far-reaching societal consequences. These new data on precipitation and runoff set the stage for far more detailed investigations than have previously been possible of climate-erosion interactions in the Himalaya.},

The results show complexity and nonlinearity in the runoff responses to precipitation changes due to parallel changes in evapotranspiration, along with changes in surface and subsurface water storage dynamics and flow pathways through the landscape.

A particular feature of the AWBM is the development of model-specific calibration procedures based on the model structure, including a graphical analysis of rainfall and runoff data, multiple linear regression and an automatic self-calibrating procedure. Application of the model for daily streamflow simulation is illustrated using data from 19 catchments located across Australia. Application at hourly time steps for design flood estimation is demonstrated on three catchments in Victoria. A procedure for use of the model to estimate daily streamflows on ungauged catchments is illustrated using the 19 catchments from the water yield study.

  abstract = {Hydro-climatic effects of future climate change in the Euphrates--Tigris Basin are investigated using dynamically downscaled outputs of different GCM (ECHAM5, CCSM3 and HadCM3) -- emissions scenario (A1FI, A2 and B1) simulations. The suite of simulations (total five) enables an analysis taking into account the A2 emission scenario simulations of three different GCMs and another analysis based on the three different emissions scenario (A1FI, A2 and B1) simulations of one GCM (CCSM3). All scenario simulations indicate winter surface temperature increases in the entire basin, however, the increase is larger in the highlands. The greatest increase in the annual temperature by the end of century belongs to the CCSM3 A1FI simulation with an increment of 6.1 {$^\circ$}C in the highlands. There is a broad agreement amongst the simulations in terms of the winter precipitation decrease in the highlands and northern parts and increase in the southern parts of the basin. A remarkable impact of warming could be seen on the snow water equivalent in the highlands where each simulation points out statistically significant decreases ranging from 55\% (lower emissions) to 87\% (higher emissions). Statistically significant declines (25--55\%) are found for the annual surface runoff of the main headwaters area. Moreover, significant temporal shifts to earlier days (between 18 and 39 days depending on the scenario) are projected to occur in the surface runoff timing in the headwaters region. Projected annual surface runoff changes in all simulations suggest that the territories of Turkey and Syria within the basin are most vulnerable to climate change as they will experience significant decreases in the annual surface runoff. Eventually, however, the downstream countries, especially Iraq, may suffer more as they rely primarily on the water released by the upstream countries. The substantial changes in the hydro-climate of the basin, therefore, are likely to increase the challenges associated with the management of several dam reservoirs and hydropower plants in the basin in addition to causing further impacts on physical and biological components of the ecosystems along these rivers.},

  abstract = {For many of the world's lakes, particularly those in remote regions, an assessment of the basin's sensitivity to climate change is limited by the availability of appropriate hydrologic data. A regional steady-state lake water balance model was developed that uses simple, yet easily estimated or obtained, data to generate an aridity index (potential evapotranspiration to precipitation ratio) to predict changes in lake basin area to lake surface area ratio, a non-dimensional lake-basin property that can be easily obtained from digital maps. In the model, lake water balance components include precipitation, lake evaporation, and runoff into the lake. Both basin runoff and evaporation are incorporated in the analytical model using an empirical equation (based on the Budyko hypothesis) that utilizes the aridity index and a calibration parameter to account for vegetative influence. Observed records of lake to basin area ratio, as a function of their evapotranspiration to precipitation ratio, for a range of climates and land cover conditions, were plotted and compared to a family of calculated steady-state curves. Dividing the domain of calculated curves into regions of permanent, land-cover change sensitive, and ephemeral lakes allows for comparison of model predicted lake classification with lake sediment records. The impact of land cover and climate change on lake persistence is also discussed. The model is most applicable for closed basin lakes in sub-humid, semi-arid, and arid environments. The model can be used: (1) as a diagnostic tool to analyze lake response to climate change; (2) to assess environmental and anthropogenic factors leading to transient lake response; and (3) as a paleoclimatic research tool, to identify lakes that can potentially provide high-resolution paleorecords of water balance.

  abstract = {This paper investigates the uncertainty of hydrological predictions due to rainfall-runoff model parameters in the context of climate change impact studies. Two sources of uncertainty were considered: (i) the dependence of the optimal parameter set on the climate characteristics of the calibration period and (ii) the use of several posterior parameter sets over a given calibration period. The first source of uncertainty often refers to the lack of model robustness, while the second one refers to parameter uncertainty estimation based on Bayesian inference. Two rainfall-runoff models were tested on 89 catchments in northern and central France. The two sources of uncertainty were assessed in the past observed period and in future climate conditions. The results show that, given the evaluation approach followed here, the lack of robustness was the major source of variability in streamflow projections in future climate conditions for the two models tested. The hydrological projections generated by an ensemble of posterior parameter sets are close to those associated with the optimal set. Therefore, it seems that greater effort should be invested in improving the robustness of models for climate change impact studies, especially by developing more suitable model structures and proposing calibration procedures that increase their robustness.

  abstract = {Paired catchment studies have been widely used as a means of determining the magnitude of water yield changes resulting from changes in vegetation. This review focuses on the use of paired catchment studies for determining the changes in water yield at various time scales resulting from permanent changes in vegetation. The review considers long term annual changes, adjustment time scales, the seasonal pattern of flows and changes in both annual and seasonal flow duration curves. The paired catchment studies reported in the literature have been divided into four broad categories: afforestation experiments, deforestation experiments, regrowth experiments and forest conversion experiments. Comparisons between paired catchment results and a mean annual water balance model are presented and show good agreement between the two methodologies. The results highlight the potential underestimation of water yield changes if regrowth experiments are used to predict the likely impact of permanent alterations to a catchment's vegetation. An analysis of annual water yield changes from afforestation, deforestation and regrowth experiments demonstrates that the time taken to reach a new equilibrium under permanent land use change varies considerably. Deforestation experiments reach a new equilibrium more quickly than afforestation experiments. The review of papers reporting seasonal changes in water yield highlights the proportionally larger impact on low flows. Flow duration curve comparison provides a potential means of gaining a greater understanding of the impact of vegetation on the distribution of daily flows. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {When constructing a hydrological model at the macroscale (e.g., watershed scale), the structure of this model will inherently be uncertain because of many factors, including the lack of a robust hydrological theory at that scale. In this work, we assume that a suitable conceptual model structure for the hydrologic system has already been determined; that is, the system boundaries have been specified, the important state variables and input and output fluxes to be included have been selected, the major hydrological processes and geometries of their interconnections have been identified, and the continuity equation (mass balance) has been assumed to hold. The remaining structural identification problem that remains, then, is to select the mathematical form of the dependence of the output on the inputs and state variables, so that a computational model can be constructed for making simulations and/or predictions of the system input-state-output behavior. The conventional approach to this problem is to preassume some fixed (and possibly erroneous) mathematical forms for the model output equations. We show instead how Bayesian data assimilation can be used to directly estimate (construct) the form of these mathematical relationships such that they are statistically consistent with macroscale measurements of the system inputs, outputs, and (if available) state variables. The resulting model has a stochastic rather than deterministic form and thereby properly represents both what we know (our certainty) and what we do not know (our uncertainty) about the underlying structure and behavior of the system. Further, the Bayesian approach enables us to merge prior beliefs in the form of preassumed model equations with information derived from the data to construct a posterior model. As a consequence, in regions of the model space for which observational data are available, the errors in preassumed mathematical form of the model can be corrected, improving model performance. For regions where no such data are available the "prior'' theoretical assumptions about the model structure and behavior will dominate. The approach, entitled Bayesian estimation of structure, is used to estimate water balance models for the Leaf River Basin, Mississippi, at annual, monthly, and weekly time scales, conditioned on the assumption of a simple single-state-variable conceptual model structure. Inputs to the system are uncertain observed precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, and outputs are estimated probability distributions of actual evapotranspiration and streamflow discharge. Results show that the models estimated for the annual and monthly time scales perform quite well. However, model performance deteriorates for the weekly time scale, suggesting limitations in the assumed form of the conceptual model.},

CWatM is open source in the Python programming environment and has a modular structure. It uses global, freely available data in the netCDF4 file format for reading, storage, and production of data in a compact way. CWatM includes general surface and groundwater hydrological processes but also takes into account human activities, such as water use and reservoir regulation, by calculating water demands, water use, and return flows. Reservoirs and lakes are included in the model scheme. CWatM is used in the framework of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP), which compares global model outputs. The flexible model structure allows for dynamic interaction with hydro-economic and water quality models for the assessment and evaluation of water management options. Furthermore, the novelty of CWatM is its combination of state-of-the-art hydrological modeling, modular programming, an online user manual and automatic source code documentation, global and regional assessments at different spatial resolutions, and a potential community to add to, change, and expand the open-source project. CWatM also strives to build a community learning environment which is able to freely use an open-source hydrological model and flexible coupling possibilities to other sectoral models, such as energy and agriculture.},

  abstract = {Climate change has the potential to alter streamflow regimes, having ecological, economic, and societal implications. In the northeastern United States, it is unclear how climate change may affect surface water supply, which is of critical importance in this densely populated region. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of climate change on the timing and quantity of streamflow at small watersheds at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The site is ideal for this analysis because of the availability of long-term hydroclimatological records for analyzing past trends and ample data to parameterize and test hydrological models used to predict future trends. In this study, future streamflow projections were developed with the forest watershed model PnET-BGC, driven by climate change scenarios from statistically downscaled outputs of atmospheric-ocean general circulation models. Results indicated that earlier snowmelt and the diminishing snowpack is advancing the timing and reducing the magnitude of peak discharge associated with snowmelt. Past increases in precipitation have caused annual water yield to increase significantly, a trend that is expected to continue under future climate change. Significant declines in evapotranspiration have been observed over the long-term record, although the cause has not been identified. In the future, evapotranspiration is expected to increase in response to a warmer and wetter environment. These increases in evapotranspiration largely offset increases in precipitation, resulting in relatively little change in streamflow. Future work should aim to decrease uncertainty in the climate projections, particularly for precipitation, obtain a better understanding of the effect of CO2 on vegetation, determine if climate-induced changes in tree species composition will influence discharge, and assess the impacts of changing hydrology on downstream water supplies.},

  abstract = {Quantile mapping bias correction algorithms are commonly used to correct systematic distributional biases in precipitation outputs from climate models. Although they are effective at removing historical biases relative to observations, it has been found that quantile mapping can artificially corrupt future model-projected trends. Previous studies on the modification of precipitation trends by quantile mapping have focused on mean quantities, with less attention paid to extremes. This article investigates the extent to which quantile mapping algorithms modify global climate model (GCM) trends in mean precipitation and precipitation extremes indices. First, a bias correction algorithm, quantile delta mapping (QDM), that explicitly preserves relative changes in precipitation quantiles is presented. QDM is compared on synthetic data with detrended quantile mapping (DQM), which is designed to preserve trends in the mean, and with standard quantile mapping (QM). Next, methods are applied to phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) daily precipitation projections over Canada. Performance is assessed based on precipitation extremes indices and results from a generalized extreme value analysis applied to annual precipitation maxima. QM can inflate the magnitude of relative trends in precipitation extremes with respect to the raw GCM, often substantially, as compared to DQM and especially QDM. The degree of corruption in the GCM trends by QM is particularly large for changes in long period return values. By the 2080s, relative changes in excess of +500\% with respect to historical conditions are noted at some locations for 20-yr return values, with maximum changes by DQM and QDM nearing +240\% and +140\%, respectively, whereas raw GCM changes are never projected to exceed +120\%.},

Based on analyses of the seasonal discharge, it is found that climatic change had a significant effect on the seasonal variation of river discharge in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In spring (from March to May) the discharge increased significantly, especially in the source area of the Yellow River. Together with the analyses on data of the mean temperature in the Northern Hemisphere and climatic data within the river basins, the relationship between discharges and mean temperature of the Northern Hemisphere is explored, which indicates that there is no increase in the stream discharge in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau with global warming. It is probably the increasing evaporation, caused by rising temperature that offsets the hydrological effect of increasing precipitation.},

This dataset encompasses daily time series of observed streamflow from 3679 gauges, as well as meteorological forcing (precipitation, evapotranspiration, and temperature) for 897 selected catchments. It also includes 65 attributes covering a range of topographic, climatic, hydrologic, land cover, geologic, soil, and human intervention variables, as well as data quality indicators. This paper describes how the hydrometeorological time series and attributes were produced, their primary limitations, and their main spatial features. To facilitate comparisons with catchments from other countries, the data follow the same standards as the previous CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies) datasets for the United States, Chile, and Great Britain. CAMELS-BR (Brazil) complements the other CAMELS datasets by providing data for hundreds of catchments in the tropics and the Amazon rainforest. Importantly, precipitation and evapotranspiration uncertainties are assessed using several gridded products, and quantitative estimates of water consumption are provided to characterize human impacts on water resources. By extracting and combining data from these different data products and making CAMELS-BR publicly available, we aim to create new opportunities for hydrological research in Brazil and facilitate the inclusion of Brazilian basins in continental to global large-sample studies. We envision that this dataset will enable the community to gain new insights into the drivers of hydrological behavior, better characterize extreme hydroclimatic events, and explore the impacts of climate change and human activities on water resources in Brazil.

We use this relation to constrain future runoff sensitivity estimates. Our statistical relationship only slightly reduces the uncertainty range of future runoff sensitivities (order 10\% reduction). However, more importantly, it raises the expected global runoff sensitivity to background global warming by 36\%-104\% compared to estimates taken directly from the CMIP6 model ensemble. The constrained sensitivities also indicate a shift towards globally more wet conditions and less dry conditions.},

However, due to the notably harsh environmental conditions, there is little field monitoring data of runoff in permafrost regions, which has limited the development of physically based models in these regions. To identify the impacts of climate change in the runoff process in the Three-River Headwater Region (TRHR) on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, two artificial neural network (ANN) models, one with three input variables (previous runoff, air temperature, and precipitation) and another with two input variables (air temperature and precipitation only), were developed to simulate and predict the runoff variation in the TRHR. The results show that the three-input variable ANN model has a superior real-time prediction capability and performs well in the simulation and forecasting of the runoff variation in the TRHR. Under the different scenarios conditions, the forecasting results of ANN model indicated that climate change has a great effect on the runoff processes in the TRHR. The results of this study are of practical significance for water resources management and the evaluation of the impacts of climatic change on the hydrological regime in long-term considerations.},

  abstract = {Water resources in river systems have been changing under the impact of both climate variability and human activities. Assessing the respective impact on decadal stream-flow variation is important for water resource management. By using an elasticity-based method and calibrated TOP-MODEL and VIC hydrological models, we quantitatively isolated the relative contributions that human activities and climate variability made to decadal streamflow changes in the Jinghe basin, located in the northwest of China. This is an important watershed of the Shaanxi province that supplies drinking water for a population of over 6 million people. The results showed that the maximum value of the moisture index (E-0/P) was 1.91 and appeared in 1991-2000, and the decreased speed of streamflow was higher since 1990 compared with 1960-1990. The average annual streamflow from 1990 to 2010 was reduced by 26.96\% compared with the multiyear average value (from 1960 to 2010). The estimates of the impacts of climate variability and human activities on streamflow decreases from the hydrological models were similar to those from the elasticity-based method. The maximum contribution value of human activities was 99\% when averaged over the three methods, and appeared in 1981-1990 due to the effects of soil and water conservation measures and irrigation water withdrawal. Climate variability made the greatest contribution to streamflow reduction in 1991-2000, the values of which was 40.4\%. We emphasized various source of errors and uncertainties that may occur in the hydrological model (parameter and structural uncertainty) and elasticity-based method (model parameter) in climate change impact studies.},

The Penman-Monteith method is considered to be the most physical and reliable method and is often used as a standard to verify other empirical methods. This study estimates and compares the monthly ET0 calculated by 3 methods at 580 Chinese stations over the last 50 yr. The Penman-Monteith method is used here as a reference, and its spatial and temporal differences with the Thornthwaite method and pan measurement are evaluated. The results show that: (1) in terms of spatial difference, the Thornthwaite estimates show different regional patterns, while pan measurements display a consistent regional pattern; (2) the temporal variability of ET0 is much better represented by pan measurements than by the Thornthwaite estimates. Overall, pan measurements are more useful than the Thornthwaite estimates if appropriate pan coefficients are determined. The Thornthwaite method only considers the temperature and latitude and gives unreliable results under dry conditions, e.g. in NW China. With reference to the Penman-Monteith estimates, the correction factors (pan coefficients) of pan measurements for the whole of China, and the regional averages over the 10 major drainage basins are determined. The average value lies between 0.6 and 0.8, although a seasonal and regional difference is present.},

  abstract = {In the past decades, human activities, including hydraulic structure construction and operation, and groundwater overexploitation have largely changed the land surface conditions and correspondingly altered the natural rainfall-runoff processes. These changes make the traditional operational flood forecasting models without considering these anthropogenic impacts fail to capture these changes, leading to a downgraded forecasting capability. To improve the accuracy of flood forecasting in semi-humid watersheds under strong aboveground and underground anthropogenic impacts, the widely used operational flood forecasting model, the Xin'anjiang model, was chosen as a basis to build a new distributed hydrological model accounting for these anthropogenic impacts. To characterize the runoff generation process under the condition of a thick unsaturated zone caused by groundwater overexploitation, this study developed a runoff generation algorithm based on an idea that conceptualizes the soil free-water storage into two virtual reservoirs. To characterize the impacts of manmade reservoirs on the runoff concentration process, we modified the Muskingum method. In addition, we further developed a priori estimation method for deriving the spatial distribution of the tension water storage capacity by considering the anthropogenic impacts and geographical conditions. Based on the above work, a Grid Xin'anjiang-Haihe model (GXH) was developed. In this study, the Qingshui River, which is a tributary of the Haihe River Basin and a typical semi-humid medium-sized watershed in China with poor flood forecasting accuracy, was selected as the study area to test the effectiveness of the model. The results show that the GXH model can simulate the flood peak flow and peak time with higher accuracy than the current operational flood forecasting models and several other models. In addition, the parameter estimation method developed in this study has also proven to be superior in theory and practice.},

  abstract = {Hydrological models at a monthly time-scale are important tools for hydrological analysis, such as in impact assessment of climate change and regional water resources planning. Traditionally, monthly models adopt a conceptual, lumped-parameter approach and cannot account for spatial variations of basin characteristics and climatic inputs. A large requirement for data often severely limits the utility of physically based, distributed-parameter models. Based on the variable-source-area concept, we considered basin topography and rainfall to be two major factors whose spatial variations play a dominant role in runoff generation and developed a monthly model that is able to account for their influences in the spatial and temporal dynamics of water balance. As a hybrid of the Xinanjiang model and TOPMODEL, the new model is constructed by innovatively making use of the highly acclaimed simulation techniques in the two existing models. A major contribution of this model development study is to adopt the technique of implicit representation of soil moisture characteristics in the Xinanjiang model and use the TOPMODEL concept to integrate terrain variations into runoff simulation. Specifically, the TOPMODEL topographic index In(a/tan beta) is converted into an index of relative difficulty in runoff generation (IRDG) and then the cumulative frequency distribution of IRDG is used to Substitute the parabolic curve, which represents the spatial variation of soil storage capacity in the Xinanjiang model. Digital elevation model data play a key role in the modelling procedures on a geographical information system platform, including basin segmentation. estimation of rainfall for each sub-basin and computation of terrain characteristics. Other monthly data for model calibration and validation are rainfall, pan evaporation and runoff. The new model has only three parameters to be estimated, i.e. watershed-average field capacity WM, pan coefficient eta and runoff generation coefficient a. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that runoff is least sensitive to WM and, therefore. it can be determined by a prior estimation based on the climate and soil properties of the study basin. The other two parameters can be determined using optimization methods. Model testing was carried out in a number of nested sub-basins of two watersheds (Yuanjiang River and Dongjiang River) in the humid region in central and southern China. Simulation results show that the model is capable of describing spatial and temporal variations of water balance components, including soil moisture content, evapotranspiration and runoff, over the watershed. With a minimal requirement for input data and parameterization, this terrain-based distributed model is a valuable contribution to the ever-advancing technology of hydrological modelling.

  abstract = {Terracing has long been considered a strategy for soil and water conservation in many mountainous regions of the world. However, the effectiveness of terracing is limited by many factors, such as climate, soil properties, topography, land use, culture, demography and socioeconomic status. The aim of this critical review is to evaluate the roles of terracing on water erosion control in China. A meta-analysis of 601 runoff and 636 sediment observations involving a diversity of terrace structures was conducted. These 1237 observations involved level terraces, slope-separated terraces, slope terraces, zig terraces, fanya juu terraces and half-moon terraces, wide geographical locations within China, a diversity of land uses from forests to bare land, and a slopes ranging from 3 to 35. The results confirmed that terracing significantly and positively affected water erosion control. In terms of different terrace structures, bench terraces were superior with respect to runoff and sediment reductions. Land use also played a crucial role in the efficiency of erosion control; terraces associated with tree crops and forests conserved the greatest amount of soil and water. In addition, a significant positive correlation between slope gradient (3-15 and 16-35) and the effect of terracing on water erosion control was observed with the greatest decreases in water erosion occurred at slopes of 26-35 and 11-15. This study revealed the effectiveness and variations of terracing with respect to water erosion control at the national scale and can serve as a scientific basis for land managers and decision makers. However with increasing urbanization, terrace abandonment increases as does the loss of place-based knowledge regarding terrace construction and maintenance.},

The models assume the runoff is related to the precipitation subject to variance of drainage basins. The runoff can be modeled as a function of precipitation and parameters determined by basin descriptive properties. The parameter values of the models can be calibrated statistically on the basis of observed historical runoff data and precipitation data. Further the parameters can be regressed to associate with the areas of different landcover types occupying the drainage basins. This regression model can be used for estimating parameter values for ungauged basins in the same study area which can be further used together with precipitation data to predict the runoff in the ungauged basins. An example of adopted Soil Conservation Service (SCS) method with application to the Oak Ridges Moraine area was introduced to demonstrate the implementation of the models introduced. The information used for the modeling and prediction includes: surficial geology, DEM, Landsat TM images, historical river flow data, and precipitation and temperature data from weather stations.

  abstract = {Parametric Budyko models express the ratio of annual actual evapotranspiration (ET) to annual precipitation (P) as a function of dryness index, i.e., annual potential evapotranspiration (ET0)/P (denoted as DI) and model parameter at a catchment. Generally the model parameter is assumed to reflect factors besides DI, especially the underlying surface features. However, recent studies have revealed its relations with DI, which forces us to further examine its connotation. We revisited the derivation of three parametric Budyko equations and found that model parameter was essentially a lumped variable representing the integrative effects of climate and underlying surface system. Then taking 15 typical catchments in the Chinese Loess Plateau as the study area, we explored the controls of Budyko-Fu model parameter (w) and their differences in temporal (between-years) and spatial (between-catchments) processes. As expected, w was affected by both climate and underlying surface factors. Specifically, DI, climate seasonality and asynchrony index (SAI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) influenced w in both temporal and spatial processes; besides, catchment relief ratio (CR) and relative infiltration capacity (ks/ir) also affected w in spatial process. SAI was strongly correlated with DI and its close relationship with w essentially conveyed DI's influence. Considering the inherent connection between DI and the inverse w, DI was not included in the empirical formula for w. SAI and NDVI remained independent in temporal process and the empirical formula for w with these two factors modeled annual ET well (MAE = 15.03 mm). In spatial process, SAI, NDVI, CR, and ks/ir were interconnected and by using any one the spatial variation of ET was captured adequately (MAE = 11.16, 11.74, 11.27, and 10.43 mm, respectively). Our results demonstrate theoretically and empirically the importance of viewing Budyko model parameter from earth system science perspective and focusing on the differences of its controls in spatiotemporal processes.},

  abstract = {In this paper we summarize recent research in geocryological studies carried out on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau that show responses of permafrost to climate change and their environmental implications. Long-term temperature measurements indicate that the lower altitudinal limit of permafrost has moved up by 25 m in the north during the last 30 years and between 50 and 80 m in the south over the last 20 years. Furthermore, the thickness of the active layer has increased by 0.15 to 0.50 m and ground temperature at a depth of 6 m has risen by about 0.1 degrees to 0.3 degrees C between 1996 and 2001. Recent studies show that freeze-thaw cycles in the ground intensify the heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ground surface. The greater the moisture content in the soil, the greater is the influence of freeze-thaw cycling on heat exchange. The water and heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ground surface due to soil freezing and thawing has a significant influence on the climate in eastern Asia. A negative correlation exists between soil moisture and heat balance on the plateau and the amount of summer precipitation in most regions of China. A simple frozen soil parameterization scheme was developed to simulate the interaction between permafrost and climate change. This model, combined with the NCAR Community Climate Model 3.6, is suitable for the simulation of permafrost changes on the plateau. In addition, permafrost degradation is one of the main causes responsible for a dropping groundwater table at the source areas of the Yangtze River and Yellow River, which in turn results in lowering lake water levels, drying swamps and shrinking grasslands.},

  abstract = {Water resources and the water cycle in high mountain areas are significantly impacted by climate change. In this study, the midstream section of the Yarlung Tsangpo River basin, situated in the southern part of the Tibetan Plateau, was chosen as the target area, and the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to assess how climate change may affect hydrological processes. The SWAT model proved effective for runoff and snow cover area simulation. Surface runoff, interflow, and groundwater accounted for 47.2\%, 24.4\%, and 28.4\% of the total runoff, respectively. The spatial distribution of runoff was mainly influenced by precipitation and glacier distribution, whereas the spatial distributions of individual runoff components were mainly influenced by soil properties. Overall, the total runoff as well as its components (surface runoff, interflow, and groundwater) increased at a rate of 0.03-0.83\%/10 yr (p {$>$} 0.05) in the study area during 1983-2017, which could be attributed to the increase in precipitation. Surface runoff peaked earlier (August) than interflow and groundwater (September), owing to the longer convergence time of interflow and groundwater. Future predictions showed a warming and wetting trend (p {$<$} 0.05) in the study area from 2020 to 2100 under the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. The total runoff was projected to increase at a rate of 0.92-3.56\%/10 yr, and the change of total runoff mainly came from the increase of surface runoff.},

  abstract = {Land use and climate change are recognized as two major drivers affecting surface streamflow. On the Chinese Loess Plateau, implementation of several land restoration projects has changed land cover in recent decades. The main objectives of this study were to understand how streamflow evolved on the Loess Plateau and how land use and climate change have contributed to this change. In this study, we selected 22 hydrological modelling studies covering 25 different watersheds in the Loess Plateau and we performed a meta-analysis by using the hydrological and meteorological data collected from these studies. The results indicate a streamflow decrease in 41 of a total of 52 case studies whereas precipitation change was found to be non-significant in the majority of the cases. Streamflow reduction was estimated to be -0.46 mm/year by meta-analysis across all case studies. Land use change was estimated to have 63.52\% impact on the streamflow reduction whereas climate change accounted for 36.48\% of the impact. Using meta-regression, an increasing soil and water conservation area was found to be positively correlated to streamflow reduction. We conclude that in the Chinese Loess Plateau, streamflow shows a decreasing trend and land restoration is the major cause of this reduction. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study that estimates streamflow dynamics across many watersheds on the entire Loess Plateau. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {There is a scarcity of streamflow data owing to the limited availability of gauge networks or delayed gauging in most parts of the world. To overcome this challenge and reproduce long-duration daily streamflow in both ungauged and poorly gauged watersheds, we proposed a novel approach that couples the process-based model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the interpretable machine learning (ML) model long short-term memory (LSTM). The watershed process features generated by SWAT were combined with meteorological fea-tures as inputs for LSTM. The coupled SWAT-LSTM approach was first developed in a data-rich coastal watershed in Fujian Province, China. During the testing period, the obtained Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) of SWAT-LSTM is 0.885, which outperformed other SWAT-MLs (e.g., backward propagation neural network, NSE = 0.843; random forest, NSE = 0.838) and calibrated SWAT (NSE = 0.706) used as comparators. Precipitation is considered the most important feature to local streamflow from a ML perspective. The pre-trained SWAT-LSTM presented satisfactory performances over 30 years of simulations in 24 hypothesized data-scarce watersheds. In ungauged watersheds, the NSE ranged from 0.474 to 0.898, with a mean of 0.685. In poorly gauged watersheds, the pre-trained SWAT-LSTM was optimized using limited local observations by introducing the transfer learning technique, and the NSE ranged from 0.591 to 0.918, with a mean of 0.760, which was markedly more accurate than the new trained models locally. Spatial proximity and physical similarity should be considered simulta-neously when selecting the optimal source for data-scarce watersheds, as better performance can be achieved in less time than with tandem trained the observations of all sources. This study demonstrates that coupling SWAT with interpretable LSTM enhances the modeling confidence and provides a potential shortcut to achieving long -duration streamflow simulations in both ungauged and poorly gauged watersheds.},

  abstract = {Precipitation changes over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) substantially impact the downstream river runoff. However, future precipitation variation over the TP remains unclear. Here, we evaluated the historical (1961-2014) precipitation of 25 CMIP6 models based on the observations. The multi-model ensemble mean of the five best models (BMME) was in stronger agreement with observations than the single model. Then, seasonal precipitation changes in 2015-2099 were projected using the BMME under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. The results showed that seasonal precipitation would increase over the TP in the 21st century, with a higher rate of precipitation increase under the higher emission scenarios. Precipitation is projected to increase by 29.3\% (11.5\%), 27.1\% (12.7\%), 23.2\% (9.4\%), and 16.7\% (2.9\%) in spring, summer, autumn, and winter by end of the 21st century relative to 1995-2014 under the high-emission SSP5-8.5 (low-emission SSP1-2.6) scenario, respectively. The largest precipitation increases in summer and autumn during 2040-2059 and 2080-2099 will occur in the southeastern TP, whereas the largest increases in winter and spring will appear in the Pamirs, where precipitation will increase by {$>$}40\% during 2080-2099 relative to 1995-2014. The spatial discrepancy in seasonal precipitation changes indicates a potential glacier expansion over the Pamirs and increased flood risks over the southeastern TP.},

Using Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) third generation data and corresponding meteorological data from 1982 to 2015, we studied the changes and drivers of the IAV of vegetation greenness as indicated by the coefficient of variation of vegetation greenness at a global scale. Dry and high-latitude areas exhibited high NDVI variability whereas humid areas exhibited relatively low NDVI variability. We detected an increase in the global IAV of vegetation greenness over time using a 15 year moving window. Spatially, we observed significant increases in the IAV of vegetation greenness in greater than 45\% of vegetated areas globally and decreases in 21\%. Our comparison of ecological models suggests good performance in terms of simulating spatial differences in vegetation variability, but relatively poor performance in terms of capturing changes in the IAV of vegetation greenness. Furthermore, the dominant climate variables controlling changes in the IAV of vegetation greenness were determined spatially using principal component regression and partial least squares regression. The two methods yielded similar patterns, revealing that temperature exerted the biggest influence on changes in the IAV of vegetation greenness, followed by solar radiation and precipitation. This study provides insights into global vegetation variability which should contribute to an understanding of vegetation dynamics in the context of climate change.},

  abstract = {Assessing the impacts of climate change on hydrologic systems is essential for establishing adaptive strategies for water resources management, flood risk control, mitigation, and ecological protection. Such assessments are typically performed by obtaining future levels of climate factors such as precipitation and temperature from climate models and coupling them with hydrological models to simulate future hydrological processes. Different algorithm choices for the hydrological cycle module lead to non-negligible uncertainties in the simulation results. Based on a case study of a small watershed located in the upper Huaihe River, China, we develop a SWAT model based analyzing workflow that integrates two evapotranspiration calculation methods (Haegeraves and Penman Monteith), two river routing models (Variable Storage and Muskingum), and four calibrated parameters sets. This workflow can identify the uncertainties from algorithms of the internal modules of the hydrological model, model parameterization, and climate model (i.e., General Circulation Models, GCMs, and climate scenarios in Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, SSPs) in the future runoff projections, and quantify their relative contributions. The results show that (1) the monthly runoff will increase in June and August and have little change in other months in 2021-2060, and increase in all months in 2061-2100; (2) annual mean runoff (Q(m)) and annual maximum runoff (Q(p)) will increase by 1.8\% and 2.6\% in the 2040s, and 14.7\% and 18.6\% in the 2080s; (3) the results of Bayesian model averaging (BMA) analysis indicates the probability of increase in Q(m) and Q(p) in all emission scenarios save the SSP 1-2.6 in the 2080s, and especially the probability of increase in Q(p) will be up to 97\%; (4) for Q(m), the evapotranspiration calculation method is the main source of uncertainty, accounting for more than half of the total uncertainty; and for Q(p), GCM, SSP, and their interaction are the main sources of uncertainty with the contribution of about 70\%. In contrast, the uncertainty arising from the parameterization of the hydrological model is small and can be ignored.},

  abstract = {Understanding the impact of climate change and human activities on the hydrological cycle of any watershed can provide a scientific basis for regional water resource planning, flood management, and disaster mitigation. An improved three-parameter hydrological model (CM) based on monthly water balance using an exponential equation to depict the distribution of groundwater storage capacity was developed and evaluated. The model uses Asian Precipitation Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation (APHRODITE) rainfall data as input, with the Zhejiang Province as the case application, and the effects of climate change and human activities on streamflow changes were assessed by separating environmental variables in this study. The results indicate that APHRODITE data has excellent monthly accuracy, with a mean correlation coefficient (CC) of more than 0.96 and an average absolute percentage bias (Pbais) of less than 5\%. The three models are relatively close in their ability to simulate high flows, but the CM simulated low flow is better than the other two models. Positive and negative Pbais phenomena occur in the CM model in each catchment, and absolute levels are regulated by 5\%. Furthermore, the CM model's average Nash efficiency coefficient (NSE) is greater than 0.9, indicating that it can correctly fulfill the water balance. The results are more consistent throughout multiple catchments in each watershed using Budyko-based and hydrological model technique to evaluate the influence of climate change and human activities on streamflow. Climate change dominated streamflow variations in 18 of the 21 catchments in Zhejiang Province, whereas human activities dominated the rest. The findings of the study will be used to influence the management, development, and usage of water resources in the watershed.},

  abstract = {The catchment of the Yangtze River in China has a long history of human occupation and the intensity of human impacts has increased markedly since economic reforms began in the late 1970s. In order to try to assess the impact of these changes on the hydrology of the river, we analyse both the annual flows of the Yangtze River and annual temperature and precipitation for the Yangtze catchment for the period 1955--2011 and for the three sections of the catchment, Upper, Middle and Lower as defined by the location of the gauging stations at Yichang, Hankou and Datong respectively. Mean annual temperature increases downstream from 12.7 {$^\circ$}C in the Upper to 16.0 {$^\circ$}C in the Lower section. A significant increasing trend in mean annual temperature is detected over the period 1955--2011 in the whole catchment and all subsections. Mean annual precipitation for the whole catchment is 1045 mm ranging from 859 mm in the elevated Upper section to 1528 mm in the Lower section. Precipitation variability is low by world standards with an annual Cv of 0.066. Using the Mann--Kendal and Rank Sums tests we do not find any trend in precipitation in the catchment. Mean annual runoff for the whole catchment is 515 mm ranging from 421 mm in the Upper Catchment to 838 mm in the Lower Catchment. Runoff variability is also low by world standards with an annual runoff Cv of 0.129. For the Middle Catchment we find a small but statistically significant increase in runoff and the runoff ratio over the period 1955--2011, possibly caused by change in the nature of the surface due to accelerated urbanization post 1980 and increased area of water storage. Overall, annual runoff in the Yangtze River shows little response to the major changes occurring in the basin. In a multiple correlation analysis of discharge, precipitation, dam volume, population and GDP, only precipitation is significantly correlated with discharge, explaining 80\% of the variance. Widespread reporting of the impact of development on the annual water yield of the Yangtze, especially the impact of dams and notably the Three Gorges Dam, are not supported by this analysis.},

  abstract = {Researchers have attempted to use machine learning algorithms to replace physically based models for streamflow prediction. Although existing studies have contributed to improving machine learning methods, they still have weaknesses, such as large dataset requirements and overfitting. Therefore, we propose an approach that combines the Weather Research and Forecasting hydrological modeling system (WRF-Hydro) and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, i.e., WRF-Hydro-LSTM, to improve streamflow simulations. In this approach, LSTM was employed to predict the residual errors of WRF-Hydro; in contrast, the conventional approach with LSTM predicts streamflow directly. Here, we performed numerical experiments to predict the inflow of Soyangho Lake in South Korea using WRF-Hydro-LSTM, WRF-Hydro-only, and LSTM-only. WRF-Hydro-LSTM and LSTM-only showed better results (NSE~=~0.95 and R~greater than~0.96) compared to WRF-Hydro-only (NSE~=~0.72 and R~=~0.88); however, in terms of the percent bias, WRF-Hydro-LSTM had a better value (1.75) than LSTM-only (17.36). While the LSTM-only follows objective functions and not physical principles, WRF-Hydro-LSTM simulates residual errors and efficiently decreases uncertainties that are inherent with conventional methods. Furthermore, a sensitivity test on the training dataset indicated that the correlation coefficient and NSE value were not overly sensitive, but the PBIAS value differed substantially depending on the training set. This study demonstrates that WRF-Hydro-LSTM is particularly useful for representing real-world physical constraints and thus can potentially improve streamflow prediction compared to using either of the two approaches exclusively.},

However, current Earth System Models (ESMs) run at spatial resolutions of hundreds of kilometers which is too coarse to analyze localized impacts. To tackle this issue, statistical downscaling is a widely employed technique that uses historical climate observations to learn a coarse-resolution to fine-resolution mapping. Traditional statistical methods are inefficient in downscaling precipitation data and vary significantly in terms of accuracy and reliability since local climate variables such as precipitation are dependent on non-linear and complex spatio-temporal processes. To capture both spatial and temporal variabilities, we develop a Super-Resolution based Convolutional Long Short Term Memory Neural Network and test the robustness and predictability of this model on monthly precipitation data in China. We integrate original climate data from an ESM and perform downscaling on precipitation at (1.25 degrees x 0.9 degrees) to (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees). Experimental data indicates that our Convolutional LSTM model performs the best compared to existing methods in terms of mean squared error, relative bias, and correlation coefficient.},

Results are as follows: (1) there is a very weak decreasing trend in annual mean SCA, and a slight increasing trend in autumn and winter and a slight decreasing trend in spring and more robust decreasing trend in summer for SCA are found. (2) The temporal variation of SCA is negatively correlated with temperature, whereas it is little correlated with corresponding precipitation. (3) The general trend of spatial SCF variation on Tibet, predominated by snow-cover variations in spring and autumn, tends to decrease in spring while it tends to increase in autumn. (4) The spatial variability of SCF is attributed to snow-cover variations in autumn and spring, which is more obvious in higher latitudes in autumn while it is more noticeable in lower-latitude southeastern plateau in spring. (5) The regions with higher variability of snow cover are main pastoral land and more prone to snow-related disaster in Tibet, becoming key zone of snow-cover monitoring and disaster prevention and mitigation.},

  abstract = {The discharge of the Nile River is highly dependent on the flow generated in the highlands of Ethiopia. However, little is known about the local (i.e. small scale) watershed hydrological response, due in part to a lack of long duration, continuous hydrological data. The goal of this paper was to develop a realistic, simple model that is useful as a tool for planning watershed management and conservation activities so that the effects of local interventions on stream flow can be predicted at a larger scale. The developed model is semi-distributed in that it divides the watershed into different regions that become hydrologically active given different amounts of effective cumulative rainfall after the start of the rainy season. A separate water balance is run for each of the hydrologic regions using rainfall and potential evaporation as the major inputs. Watershed parameters that were calibrated included the amount of water required before each region becomes hydrologically active, the fraction of soil water that becomes runoff and subsurface flow, and aquifer characteristics, Model validation indicated that daily discharge values were predicted reasonably well with Nash Sutcliffe values ranging from 0.56 to 0.78. Despite the large distance between the test watersheds, the input parameter values for the watershed characteristic were remarkably similar for the humid highlands, indicating that the model could be used to predict discharge in un-gauged basins in the region. As expected, the watershed in the semi-arid region behaved somewhat differently than the other three watersheds. Good quality precipitation data, even for short durations, were key to the effective modelling of runoff in the highland watersheds. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Accurate assessment of global river flows and stores is critical for informing water management practices, but current estimates of global river flows exhibit substantial spread and estimates of river stores remain sparse. Estimates of river flows and stores are hampered by uncertainties in land runoff, an unobserved quantity that provides water input to rivers. Here we leverage global river flow observations and an ensemble of land surface models to generate a globally gauge-corrected monthly river flow and storage dataset. We estimate a global river storage mean ({\textpm} monthly variability) of 2,246\,{\textpm}\,505 km3 and a global continental flow of 37,411\,{\textpm}\,7,816\,km3\,yr-1. Our global river water storage time series demonstrates that flow wave residence time is a fundamental driver that can double or halve river water stores and their variability. We also reconcile the wide range in previous estimates of monthly variability in global river flows. We identify previously underappreciated freshwater sources to the ocean from the Maritime Continent (Indonesia, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea) amounting to 1.6 times the Congo River and illustrate our capability of detecting severe anthropogenic water withdrawals.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the development and validation of a water balance model of the Upper Blue Nile in Ethiopia. A major requirement of any modelling attempt is the availability of climatic and hydrological data. However, for the Upper Blue Nile, only a limited number of observation sites are available over a very large area. As a result, the model described here is a grid-based water balance model which requires limited data inputs, few parameters and runs on a monthly time-step. Climate is dominated by the influence of elevation in the river basin. Estimates of potential evapotranspiration (PE) and rainfall are predicted for 10-minute resolution grid cells for input to the model. These estimates are based on multiple regression models using latitude, longitude and elevation. In the basin, annual mean PE and rainfall range, with increasing elevation, from 1800 mm to 1200 mm and 924 mm to 1845 mm, respectively. In the model, vegetation cover is not explicitly treated and soil characteristics are spatially invariant. The model is calibrated to reproduce mean monthly runoff over a 37-year period (1953-1987), and validated by its ability to simulate sub-catchment runoff and historical variations in Blue Nile runoff. The key factor that determines model performance is the quality of the rainfall inputs, with the best results obtained with a time series comprised of long, good quality station data. Over a 76-year period the correlation between observed and simulated annual flows was 0.74 and the mean error was 14\%, although fairly large errors occurred in individual years. Considering the paucity of data for the basin, these results are encouraging. The model is used to investigate spatial variability in the sensitivity of runoff to changes in rainfall and PE. The sensitivity is greatly affected by the runoff ratio of the model grid cells and it increases as grid cell runoff ratio decreases. The sensitivity is also affected by the seasonal distribution of rainfall. The paper ends with a discussion of the model's performance and its potential for future development.},

  abstract = {There is strong evidence that climate change will increase drought risk and severity, but these conclusions depend on the regions, seasons, and drought metrics being considered. We analyze changes in drought across the hydrologic cycle (precipitation, soil moisture, and runoff) in projections from Phase Six of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The multimodel ensemble shows robust drying in the mean state across many regions and metrics by the end of the 21st century, even following the more aggressive mitigation pathways (SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5). Regional hotspots with strong drying include western North America, Central America, Europe and the Mediterranean, the Amazon, southern Africa, China, Southeast Asia, and Australia. Compared to SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, however, the severity of drying in the lower warming scenarios is substantially reduced and further precipitation declines in many regions are avoided. Along with drying in the mean state, the risk of the historically most extreme drought events also increases with warming, by 200-300\% in some regions. Soil moisture and runoff drying in CMIP6 is more robust, spatially extensive, and severe than precipitation, indicating an important role for other temperature-sensitive drought processes, including evapotranspiration and snow. Given the similarity in drought responses between CMIP5 and CMIP6, we speculate that both generations of models are subject to similar uncertainties, including vegetation processes, model representations of precipitation, and the degree to which model responses to warming are consistent with observations. These topics should be further explored to evaluate whether CMIP6 models offer reasons to have increased confidence in drought projections.},

As with the initial version implemented in 2016, NWM v2.1 is an hourly cycling analysis and forecast system that provides streamflow guidance for millions of river reaches and other hydrologic information on high-resolution grids. The NWM provides complementary hydrologic guidance at current NWS river forecast locations and significantly expands guidance coverage and water budget information in underserved locations. It produces a full range of hydrologic fields, which can be leveraged by a broad cross section of stakeholders ranging from the emergency responder and water resource communities, to transportation, energy, recreation and agriculture interests, to other water-oriented applications in the government, academic and private sectors. Version 2.1 of the NWM represents the fifth major version upgrade and more than doubles simulation skill with respect to hourly streamflow correlation, Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency, and bias reduction, over its original inception in 2016. This paper will discuss the driving factors underpinning the creation of the NWM, provide a brief overview of the model configuration and performance, and discuss future efforts to improve NWM components and services.},

  abstract = {Recent reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere temperatures and climate forcing over the past 1000 years allow the warming of the 20th century to be placed within a historical context and various mechanisms of climate change to be tested. Comparisons of observations with simulations from an energy balance climate model indicate that as much as 41 to 64\% of preanthropogenic (pre-1850) decadal-scale temperature variations was due to changes in solar irradiance and volcanism. Removal of the forced response from reconstructed temperature time series yields residuals that show similar variability to those of control runs of coupled models, thereby lending support to the models' value as estimates of low-frequency variability in the climate system. Removal of all forcing except greenhouse gases from the {$\sim$}1000-year time series results in a residual with a very large late-20th-century warming that closely agrees with the response predicted from greenhouse gas forcing. The combination of a unique level of temperature increase in the late 20th century and improved constraints on the role of natural variability provides further evidence that the greenhouse effect has already established itself above the level of natural variability in the climate system. A 21st-century global warming projection far exceeds the natural variability of the past 1000 years and is greater than the best estimate of global temperature change for the last interglacial.},

The annual mean streamflow for seven rivers at 1.5 degrees C warming level decreases by 0.1-3.2\% relative to the present-day climate condition, and increases by 1.5-12\% at 3.0 degrees C warming level. The shifting river flows for the Yellow, Yangtze, Brahmaputra, and Ganges are mostly influenced by projected increases in rainfall, but those for the Mekong, Salween, and Indus are dictated by the relative changes in rainfall, snowmelt and glacier melt. Reduced river flows in a moderately warmed climate threaten water security in riparian countries, while elevated flood risks are expected with further temperature increases over the Tibetan Plateau.

Rising atmospheric CO2 influences the terrestrial hydrological cycle through climate-radiative and vegetation-physiological forcings. How these two forcings affect the seasonal intensity and characteristics of monsoonal precipitation and runoff is poorly understood. Here we use four Earth System Models to show that in a CO2-enriched climate, radiative forcing changes drive annual precipitation increases for most monsoon regions. Further, vegetation feedbacks substantially affect annual precipitation in North and South America and Australia monsoon regions. In the dry season, runoff increases over most monsoon regions, due to stomatal closure-driven evapotranspiration reductions and associated atmospheric circulation change. Our results imply that flood risks may amplify in the wet season. However, the lengthening of the monsoon rainfall season and reduced evapotranspiration will shorten the water resources scarcity period for most monsoon regions.},

Multiple satellite rainfall estimates combined with gauge observations allow for a quantitative analysis of precipitation anomalies in the tropics and elsewhere accompanying the 1997--1999 ENSO cycle. An examination of the evolution of the El Ni{\~n}o and accompanying precipitation anomalies revealed that a dry Maritime Continent (MC) preceded the formation of positive sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Thirty- to sixty-day oscillations in the winter of 1996--1997 may have contributed to this lag relationship. Furthermore, westerly wind burst events may have maintained the drought over the MC. The warming of the equatorial Pacific was then followed by an increase in convection. A rapid transition from El Ni{\~n}o to La Ni{\~n}a occurred in May 1998, but as early as October--November 1997, precipitation indices captured substantial changes in Pacific rainfall anomalies. The global precipitation patterns for this event were in good agreement with the strong consistent ENSO-related precipitation signals identified in earlier studies. Differences included a shift in precipitation anomalies over Africa during the 1997--1998 El Ni{\~n}o and unusually wet conditions over northeast Australia during the later stages of the El Ni{\~n}o. Also, the typically wet region in the north tropical Pacific was mostly dry during the 1998--1999 La Ni{\~n}a. Reanalysis precipitation was compared with observations during this time period and substantial differences were noted. In particular, the model had a bias towards positive precipitation anomalies and the magnitudes of the anomalies in the equatorial Pacific were small compared with the observations. Also, the evolution of the precipitation field, including the drying of the MC and eastward progression of rainfall in the equatorial Pacific, was less pronounced for the model compared with the observations.

The present paper aims to analyze applicability and limitations of two regionalization procedures for estimating the parameters of simple rainfall-runoff models respectively based on a "two-step" and on a "one-step" approach, for the estimation of monthly streamflow series in ungauged basins. In particular, an application to a Sicilian river basin of multiple regression equations according to a "two-step" and a "one-step" approaches and of a "one-step" approach based on neural networks is reported. For the investigated region, results indicate that models based on the "one-step" approach appear to be robust and adequate for estimating the streamflows in ungauged basins.},

  abstract = {Anew dataset of historical monthly streamflow at the farthest downstream stations for the world's 925 largest ocean-reaching rivers has been created for community use. Available new gauge records are added to a network of gauges that covers similar to 80 x 10(6) km(2) or similar to 80\% of global ocean-draining land areas and accounts for about 73\% of global total runoff. For most of the large rivers, the record for 1948-2004 is fairly complete. Data gaps in the records are filled through linear regression using streamflow simulated by a land surface model [ Community Land Model, version 3 (CLM3)] forced with observed precipitation and other atmospheric forcings that are significantly ( and often strongly) correlated with the observed streamflow for most rivers. Compared with previous studies, the new dataset has improved homogeneity and enables more reliable assessments of decadal and long-term changes in continental freshwater discharge into the oceans. The model-simulated runoff ratio over drainage areas with and without gauge records is used to estimate the contribution from the areas not monitored by the gauges in deriving the total discharge into the global oceans. Results reveal large variations in yearly streamflow for most of the world's large rivers and for continental discharge, but only about one-third of the top 200 rivers ( including the Congo, Mississippi, Yenisey, Parana, Ganges, Columbia, Uruguay, and Niger) show statistically significant trends during 1948-2004, with the rivers having downward trends ( 45) outnumbering those with upward trends ( 19). The interannual variations are correlated with the El Nino-SouthernnOscillation (ENSO) events for discharge into the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and global ocean as a whole. For ocean basins other than the Arctic, and for the global ocean as a whole, the discharge data show small or downward trends, which are statistically significant for the Pacific (-9.4 km(3) yr(-1)). Precipitation is a major driver for the discharge trends and large interannual-to-decadal variations. Comparisons with the CLM3 simulation suggest that direct human influence on annual streamflow is likely small compared with climatic forcing during 1948-2004 for most of the world's major rivers. For the Arctic drainage areas, upward trends in streamflow are not accompanied by increasing precipitation, especially over Siberia, based on available data, although recent surface warming and associated downward trends in snow cover and soil ice content over the northern high latitudes contribute to increased runoff in these regions. The results are qualitatively consistent with climate model projections but contradict an earlier report of increasing continental runoff during the recent decades based on limited records.},

  abstract = {Annual and monthly mean values of continental freshwater discharge into the oceans are estimated at 18 resolution using several methods. The most accurate estimate is based on streamflow data from the world's largest 921 rivers, supplemented with estimates of discharge from unmonitored areas based on the ratios of runoff and drainage area between the unmonitored and monitored regions. Simulations using a river transport model (RTM) forced by a runoff field were used to derive the river mouth outflow from the farthest downstream gauge records. Separate estimates are also made using RTM simulations forced by three different runoff fields: 1) based on observed streamflow and a water balance model, and from estimates of precipitation P minus evaporation E computed as residuals from the atmospheric moisture budget using atmospheric reanalyses from 2) the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) and 3) the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Compared with previous estimates, improvements are made in extending observed discharge downstream to the river mouth, in accounting for the unmonitored streamflow, in discharging runoff at correct locations, and in providing an annual cycle of continental discharge. The use of river mouth outflow increases the global continental discharge by similar to19\% compared with unadjusted streamflow from the farthest downstream stations. The river-based estimate of global continental discharge presented here is 37 288 +/- 662 km(3) yr(-1), which is similar to7.6\% of global P or 35\% of terrestrial P. While this number is comparable to earlier estimates, its partitioning into individual oceans and its latitudinal distribution differ from earlier studies. The peak discharges into the Arctic, the Pacific, and global oceans occur in June, versus May for the Atlantic and August for the Indian Oceans. Snow accumulation and melt are shown to have large effects on the annual cycle of discharge into all ocean basins except for the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean and Black Seas. The discharge and its latitudinal distribution implied by the observation-based runoff and the ECMWF reanalysis-based P-E agree well with the river-based estimates, whereas the discharge implied by the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis-based P-E has a negative bias.},

Our results can be used to evaluate climate models and forecast ENSO-induced precipitation anomalies.},

  abstract = {Global hydroclimatic changes from 1950 to 2018 are analyzed using updated data of land precipitation, streamflow, and an improved form of the Palmer Drought Severity Index. The historical changes are then compared with climate model-simulated response to external forcing to determine how much of the recent change~is forced response. It is found that precipitation has increased from 1950 to 2018 over mid-high latitude Eurasia, most North America, Southeast South America, and Northwest Australia, while it has decreased over most Africa, eastern Australia, the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and parts of East Asia, central South America, and the Pacific coasts of Canada. Streamflow records largely confirm these precipitation changes. The wetting trend over Northwest Australia and Southeast South America is most pronounced in austral summer while the drying over Africa and wetting trend over mid-high latitude Eurasia are seen in all seasons. Coupled with the drying caused by rising surface temperatures, these precipitation changes have greatly increased the risk of drought over Africa, southern Europe, East Asia, eastern Australia, Northwest Canada, and southern Brazil. Global land precipitation and continental freshwater discharge show large interannual and inter-decadal variations, with negative anomalies during El Ni{\~n}o and following major volcanic eruptions in 1963, 1982, and 1991; whereas their decadal variations are correlated with the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) with IPO's warm phase associated with low land precipitation and continental discharge. The IPO and Atlantic multidecadal variability also dominate multidecadal variations in land aridity, accounting for 90\,\% of the multidecadal variance. CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean shows decreased precipitation and runoff and increased risk of drought during 1950--2018 over Southwest North America, Central America, northern and central South America (including the Amazon), southern and West Africa, the Mediterranean region, and Southeast Asia; while the northern mid-high latitudes, Southeast South America, and Northwest Australia see increased precipitation and runoff. The consistent spatial patterns between the observed changes and the model-simulated response suggest that many of the observed drying and wetting trends since 1950 may have resulted at least partly from historical external forcing. However, the drying over Southeast Asia and wetting over Northwest Australia are absent in the 21st century projections.},

As a hybrid model coupling Pettitt's test method with an iterative algorithm and iterative cumulative sum of squares algorithm, it can determine the reconstructed components and implement the recombination depending only on the information of change points in observed annual streamflow records. Results showed that NSR-SVI is suitable for reconstructing natural series and can provide the stable streamflow processes under different human influences to better serve the hydrologic design of water resource engineering. Also, the proposed approach combining the cumulative streamflow curve provides an innovative way to investigate the attributions of streamflow variation, and the performance has been verified by comparing with the relevant results in nearby basin.},

Therefore, to stimulate effective basin management, we investigated the trends in temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and water availability under 1.5 and 2 degrees C warming levels across the transboundary Teesta river basin. The ensemble median of five bias-corrected model outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) was used for this purpose. The results indicate that the temperature is expected to significantly increase (decrease) in the near (far) future, along with an overall significant increasing trend in monsoon precipitation. The evaporation paradox is found in the near future, and the water availability is likely to increase, with some exceptions for the pre-monsoon season. The perpetuation of such changes might result in environmental degradation through snow melting, glacial recession, and floods. Anticipating the changing climatic scenarios and their possible impacts, in this study, we recommend a variety of short- and long-term strategies for the concerned stakeholders to implement the Sustainable Development Goal 13, i.e., "Climate Action", over the Teesta river basin.},

Hourly streamflow and rainfall data from the two river basins were used to evaluate the accuracy of the methods at one-hour, threehour, and six-hour prediction intervals. The results showed that all three deep learning methods performed with high accuracy in predicting streamflow. The study also found that LSTM performed better in small basin with well spatial distributed rainfall stations, while CNN and ConvLSTM were more effective in moderate to high streamflow, and large river basin. Moreover, early prediction intervals had better accuracy compared to later ones. The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of using deep learning methods for short-term streamflow forecasting in water resource management. The study highlights the importance of accurate shortterm streamflow forecasting and emphasizes the potential of using deep learning algorithms to achieve this goal.},

The datasets consist of satellite-based diagnostic models (MOD16A2, SSEBop, ALEXI, CMRSET, SEBS), satellite-based prognostic models (GLEAM v3.2a, GLEAM v3.3a, GLEAM v3.2b, GLEAM v3.3b), and reanalysis (ERA5, MERRA-2, JRA-55). Four distinct multivariate calibration strategies (basin-average, pixel-wise, spatial bias-accounting and spatial bias-insensitive) using actual evaporation and streamflow are implemented, resulting in 48 scenarios whose results are compared with a benchmark model calibrated solely with streamflow data. A process-diagnostic approach is adopted to evaluate the model responses with in-situ data of streamflow and independent remotely sensed data of soil moisture from ESA-CCI and terrestrial water storage from GRACE. The method is implemented in the Volta River basin, which is a data scarce region in West Africa, for the period from 2003 to 2012. Results show that the evaporation datasets have a good potential for improving model calibration, but this is dependent on the calibration strategy. All the multivariate calibration strategies outperform the streamflow-only calibration. The highest improvement in the overall model performance is obtained with the spatial bias-accounting strategy (+29\%), followed by the spatial bias-insensitive strategy (+26\%) and the pixel-wise strategy (+24\%), while the basin-average strategy (+20\%) gives the lowest improvement. On average, using evaporation data in addition to streamflow for model calibration decreases the model performance for streamflow (-7\%), which is counterbalance by the increase in the performance of the terrestrial water storage (+11\%), temporal dynamics of soil moisture (+6\%) and spatial patterns of soil moisture (+89\%). In general, the top three best performing evaporation datasets are MERRA-2, GLEAM v3.3a and SSEBop, while the bottom three datasets are MOD16A2, SEBS and ERA5. However, performances of the evaporation products diverge according to model responses and across climatic zones. These findings open up avenues for improving process representation of hydrological models and advancing the spatiotemporal prediction of floods and droughts under climate and land use changes.},

  abstract = {Hydrological model parameters play an important role in the ability of model prediction. In a stationary context, parameters of hydrological models are treated as constants; however, model parameters may vary with time under climate change and anthropogenic activities. The technique of ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is proposed to identify the temporal variation of parameters for a two-parameter monthly water balance model (TWBM) by assimilating the runoff observations. Through a synthetic experiment, the proposed method is evaluated with time-invariant (i.e., constant) parameters and different types of parameter variations, including trend, abrupt change and periodicity. Various levels of observation uncertainty are designed to examine the performance of the EnKF. The results show that the EnKF can successfully capture the temporal variations of the model parameters. The application to the Wudinghe basin shows that the water storage capacity (SC) of the TWBM model has an apparent increasing trend during the period from 1958 to 2000. The identified temporal variation of SC is explained by land use and land cover changes due to soil and water conservation measures. In contrast, the application to the Tongtianhe basin shows that the estimated SC has no significant variation during the simulation period of 1982-2013, corresponding to the relatively stationary catchment properties. The evapotranspiration parameter (C) has temporal variations while no obvious change patterns exist. The proposed method provides an effective tool for quantifying the temporal variations of the model parameters, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of model simulations and forecasts.},

Yarlung Zangbo basin (YZB) is one of most important major rivers originating from TP sustaining billions of lives in the downstream alluvial plain. Climate change has impacted the hydrological cycle in this alpine region; however, the temporal and spatial trends of runoff and the water balance has not been quantified adequately. Here, we have optimized the snowmelt module of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the YZB to quantify the historical and future variability in the runoff, snowmelt water, and water balance components. According to the results of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Five and Six (CMIP5 and CMIP6) the future precipitation (2020-2099) projected by the CMIP6 will increase by 2.7\% when compared to historical reference (1980-2019), while the precipitation will increase by 10.2\% when projected by the CMIP5. The increase in average air temperature (2.4?) projected by CMIP6 exceeds that of CMIP5 (1.9?). The runoff between 2020 and 2050 will decrease by -12.7\% compared with historical reference, and it will further decline by -9.2\% during 2060 and 2099. Based on the average results of CMIP5 and CMIP6, the water balance deficit will increase primarily due to an increase in evaporation of 42.4\%, whereas snowmelt (-32.1\%), water yield (-9.4\%), soil water (-19.8\%), and groundwater recharge (-17.8\%) will decrease. Long-term water balance evaluation implicates that middle and upper reaches will face a higher risk of drought, implying a potential threat to the sustainability of grassland ecosystems upstream.},

  abstract = {Parameters are usually assumed to be stationary, and regarded as constants in hydrological modelling. However, studies have shown that model parameters may vary temporally due to human activities, and climate variability and changes. This study proposes a framework for quantifying hydrological model parameters as functions of time-variant catchment properties, aiming to improve the capability of capturing hydrograph and the extra-polative ability of hydrological models under a changing environment. The framework includes four steps: (1) estimating model parameters by using an ensemble Kalman filter based on the observations; (2) analyzing correlations between estimated parameter values and catchment properties; (3) constructing a set of parameter functions based on the identified catchment properties and the proposed functional forms; and (4) selecting and testing the best-performed model. As a demonstration of the framework, the monthly water balance for Tongtianhe and Ganjiang basins in China with different climate are simulated using a two-parameter monthly water balance model. Results from the Tongtianhe Basin show that considering the time-variant evapotranspiration parameter (C) brings improvement in low flows when water storage capacity (SC) is treated as constant since there is no significant improvement in runoff simulation when SC is treated as a time-variant parameter. The application to Ganjiang Basin shows that reasonable improvements are achieved when both C and SC are treated as time-variant, especially in low and high flows. The presented framework provides a useful tool for estimating time-variant parameters of hydrological models, thereby leading to more reliable model predictions under a changing environment.},

  abstract = {The temporal variation of model parameters is affected by the catchment conditions and has a significant impact on hydrological simulation. This study aims to evaluate the seasonality and downscaling of model parameter across time scales based on monthly and mean annual water balance models with a common model framework. Two parameters of the monthly model, i.e., k and m, are assumed to be time-variant at different months. Based on the hydrological data set from 121 MOPEX catchments in the United States, we firstly analyzed the correlation between parameters (k and m) and catchment properties (NDVI and frequency of rainfall events, alpha). The results show that parameter k is positively correlated with NDVI or alpha, while the correlation is opposite for parameter m, indicating that precipitation and vegetation affect monthly water balance by controlling temporal variation of parameters k and m. The multiple linear regression is then used to fit the relationship between 8 and the means and coefficient of variations of parameters k and m. Based on the empirical equation and the correlations between the time-variant parameters and NDVI, the mean annual parameter s is downscaled to monthly k and m. The results show that it has lower NSEs than these from model with time-variant k and m being calibrated through SCE-UA, while for several study catchments, it has higher NSEs than that of the model with constant parameters. The proposed method is feasible and provides a useful tool for temporal scaling of model parameter. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Monthly hydrological models are very useful tools for modeling of catchment hydrology. In this study, a two-stage partitioning monthly water balance model (TSPM) with three parameters is developed based on a generalized proportionality hypothesis. A total of four model scenarios are conducted to investigate the effects of calculation procedures of the soil water content on model performances by incorporating the hyperbolic tangent function used in the two-parameter monthly water balance model (TWBM) by Xiong and Guo (1999). The developed monthly models are then tested in 205 Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) basins across the United States. Application results demonstrate that the three-parameter model TSPM1 performs well and has better performance than the modified two-parameter model TSPM4 using the equations of soil moisture and runoff from the TWBM. Five monthly models with different structures and model parameter numbers are compared to the two developed TSPM models. Results show that the TSPM1 and TSPM4 models have a median performance among these models. They show an excellent performance in high flow, but a relatively weak performance in low flow, especially for the TSPM4 model. The relationship between the model performances and catchment characteristics is explored and results demonstrate that the climate and vegetation conditions of catchment (e.g., aridity index and forest fraction) exert very significant effects on model performances, including entire goodness-of-fit, low and high flows in runoff simulations.},

Here we analyse past hydro-climatic, agricultural and hydropower changes from twentieth century data for nine major Swedish drainage basins, and synthesize and compare these results with other regional(5-7) and global(2) assessments of hydrological change by irrigation and deforestation. Cross-regional comparison shows similar increases of evapotranspiration by non-irrigated agriculture and hydropower as for irrigated agriculture. In the Swedish basins, non-irrigated agriculture has also increased, whereas hydropower has decreased temporal runoff variability. A global indication of the regional results is a net total increase of evapotranspiration that is larger than a proposed associated planetary boundary(8). This emphasizes the need for climate and Earth system models to account for different human uses of water as anthropogenic drivers of hydro-climatic change. The present study shows how these drivers and their effects can be distinguished and quantified for hydrological basins on different scales and in different world regions. This should encourage further exploration of greater basin variety for better understanding of anthropogenic hydro-climatic change.},

  abstract = {Climate change and human activity are two major drivers that alter hydrological cycle processes and cause change in spatio-temporal distribution of water availability. Streamflow, the most important component of hydrological cycle undergoes variation which is expected to be influenced by climate change as well as human activities. Since these two affecting conditions are time dependent, having unequal influence, identification of the change point in natural flow regime is of utmost important to separate the individual impact of climate change and human activities on streamflow variability. Subsequently, it is important as well for framing adaptation strategies and policies for regional water resources planning and management. In this paper, a comprehensive review of different approaches used by research community to isolate the impacts of climate change and human activities on streamflow are presented. The important issues pertaining to different approaches, to make rational use of methodology, are discussed so that researcher and policymaker can understand the importance of individual methodology and its use in water resources management. A new approach has also been suggested to select a representative change point under different scenarios of human activities with incorporation of climate variability/change. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study presents an exploration of the composition variation characteristics of precipitation time series under global climate change. Twelve CMIP6 models were used to forecast precipitation changes in the Yellow River Basin (YRB). Climatic Research Unit (CRU) data were applied in the analysis of historical precipitation. Trend analysis, precipitation bias correction, and Fourier functions were used to analyze the future precipitation change characteristics. Our results showed that the IPSL-CM6A-LR and EC-Earth3-CC models had excellent performances in simulating precipitation in the YRB. Most CMIP6 models showed that precipitation under the SSP5-8.5 scenario had a higher increasing trend and was higher than that under the SSP2-4.5 scenario. The multimodel ensemble means (MEM) of CMIP6 precipitation showed that the future trend and stochastic component of precipitation had a higher degree of contribution than the historical trend and stochastic component of precipitation. However, the future periodic component of precipitation had a lower degree of contribution than the historical component. Most models showed that the degree of contribution of the periodic component of precipitation in Period IV (2015-2057) was higher than that in Period V (2058-2100). Most models showed similar degrees of contribution in Period I (1901-1938), Period II (1939-1976), and Period III (1977-2014). However, the degree of contribution of the stochastic component in 2058-2100 was lower than that in 2015-2057. This study improves the understanding of future precipitation change characteristics and provides a reference for disaster prevention and mitigation in the YRB.},

This paper presents a systematic examination of the inherent stability changes of glaciers and permafrost caused by warming. Various study results suggest that over the past 30 years, the internal temperature of glaciers and permafrost exhibits an overall accelerating warming trend. The warming rate peaked in the mid-2000s and slowed slightly for several years afterward. In recent years, however, the warming rate has seemed to pick up again. The warming of glaciers and permafrost has exerted great impact on their stability, displayed as intensified melting, increased glacier surging, enlargement of supraglacial lakes, and increased permafrost degradation. Even without a future temperature increase, some glaciers will continue to shrink, and the number of surging glaciers will increase. The transition from low-temperature to high-temperature permafrost is a noticeable warning sign of a comprehensive degradation of permafrost. These results indicate that ``warming'' glaciers and permafrost will exert significant impacts on the hydrology, ecology, and stability of engineering in cold regions.},

  abstract = {Freshwater availability has been recognized as a global issue, and its consistent quantification not only in individual river basins but also at the global scale is required to support the sustainable use of water. The WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model WGHM, which is a submodel of the global water use and availability model WaterGAP 2, computes surface runoff, groundwater recharge and river discharge at a spatial resolution of 0.5{$^\circ$}. WGHM is based on the best global data sets currently available, and simulates the reduction of river discharge by human water consumption. In order to obtain a reliable estimate of water availability, it is tuned against observed discharge at 724 gauging stations, which represent 50\% of the global land area and 70\% of the actively discharging area. For 50\% of these stations, the tuning of one model parameter was sufficient to achieve that simulated and observed long-term average discharges agree within 1\%. For the rest, however, additional corrections had to be applied to the simulated runoff and discharge values. WGHM not only computes the long-term average water resources of a country or a drainage basin but also water availability indicators that take into account the interannual and seasonal variability of runoff and discharge. The reliability of the modeling results is assessed by comparing observed and simulated discharges at the tuning stations and at selected other stations. The comparison shows that WGHM is able to calculate reliable and meaningful indicators of water availability at a high spatial resolution. In particular, the 90\% reliable monthly discharge is simulated well. Therefore, WGHM is suited for application in global assessments related to water security, food security and freshwater ecosystems.},

Existing sliding window-based methods usually use a fixed-size window, for which the window size selection is random, resulting in large errors. This paper proposes a dynamic sliding window method that reflects the different timing and periodicity characteristics of the streamflow in different months of the year. Multiple datasets of different months are generated using a dynamic window at first, then the long-short term memory (LSTM) is used to select the optimal window, and finally, the dataset of the optimal window size is used for verification. The proposed method was tested using the hydrological data of Zhutuo Hydrological Station (China). A comparison between the flow prediction data and the measured data shows that the prediction method based on a dynamic sliding window LSTM is more accurate by 8.63\% and 3.85\% than the prediction method based on fixed window LSTM and the dynamic sliding window back-propagation neural network, respectively. This method can be generally used for the time series data prediction with different periodic characteristics.},

  abstract = {This study examines whether the incorporation of dynamic, remotely sensed vegetation information into Budyko's hydrological model can improve that model's accuracy, particularly at finer spatial and temporal scales. Using numerous variables derived from three primary time-series variables (precipitation, potential evaporation and remotely sensed estimates of vegetation cover), linear one-variable models are developed to explain the variability in stream flow predictions not already captured by the Budyko model (the 'scatter'). Analyses are applied to 221 catchments across Australia and cover the period 1981-2006. At the annual average temporal scale, results show that vegetation-related variables are not the primary determinants of scatter at coarse spatial scales (i.e., continental), and that little improvement could be made on the original Budyko model. However, at medium spatial scales vegetation-related variables dominate models - most notably variables relating to intra-annual dynamics in vegetation cover - reducing prediction error to 30\% of average annual stream flow from the 42\% error achieved using the original Budyko model. By contrast, at the annual time-scale the most important variables for explaining scatter relate to precipitation dynamics regardless of spatial scale. This is interpreted as the influence of non-steady-state conditions at this finer time-scale. Overall, vegetation information is shown to improve the accuracy of long-term annual average stream flow predictions as spatial scale decreases and that, at annual scales, the presence of non-steady-state conditions prohibits the exploration of the hydrological role of vegetation dynamics regardless of spatial scales of analysis.},

  abstract = {The Budyko curve describes the patterns observed between between climate, evapotranspiration and run-off and has proven to be a useful model for predicting catchment energy and water balances. In this paper we review the Budyko curve's underlying framework and, based on the literature, present an argument for why it is important to include vegetation dynamics into the framework for some purposes. The Budyko framework assumes catchments are at steady-state and are driven by the macro-climate, two conditions dependent on the scales of application, such that the framework's reliability is greatest when applied using long-term averages ({$>>$} 1 year) and to large catchments ({$>$} 10 000 km(2)). At these scales previous experience has shown that the hydrological role of vegetation does not need to be explicitly considered within the framework. By demonstrating how dynamics in the leaf area, photosynthetic capacity and rooting depth of vegetation affect not only annual and seasonal vegetation water use, but also steady-state conditions, we argue that it is necessary to explicitly include vegetation dynamics into the Budyko framework before it is applied at small scales. Such adaptations would extend the framework not only to applications at small timescales and/or small catchments but to operational activities relating to vegetation and water management.},

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to synthesize the large literature recording changing patterns of precipitation in the observed data, thus indicating that climate change is already a reality. Such a synthesis is required not only for environmental researchers but also for policy makers. The key question is the broad picture at major regional and continental levels. Some interesting conclusions for this survey are emerging. For example, the review shows increased variance of precipitation everywhere. Consistent with this finding, we observe that wet areas become wetter, and dry and arid areas become more so. In addition, the following general changing pattern is emerging: (a) increased precipitation in high latitudes (Northern Hemisphere); (b) reductions in precipitation in China, Australia and the Small Island States in the Pacific; and (c) increased variance in equatorial regions. The changes in the major ocean currents also appear to be affecting precipitation patterns. For example, increased intensity and frequency of El Nin{\texttildelow}o and ENSO seem associated with evidence of an observed ``dipole'' pattern affecting Africa and Asia, although this time series is too short so far. But the changing pattern calls for renewed efforts at adaptation to climate change, as the changing precipitation pattern will also affect the regional availability of food supply.},

  abstract = {The successful application of a conceptual rainfall-runoff (CRR) model depends on how well it is calibrated. Despite the popularity of CRR models, reports in the literature indicate that it is typically difficult, if not impossible, to obtain unique optimal values for their parameters using automatic calibration methods. Unless the best set of parameters associated with a given calibration data set can be found, it is difficult to determine how sensitive the parameter estimates (and hence the model forecasts) are to factors such as input and output data error, model error, quantity and quality of data, objective function used, and so on. Results are presented that establish clearly the nature of the multiple optima problem for the research CRR model SIXPAR. These results suggest that the CRR model optimization problem is more difficult than had been previously thought and that currently used local search procedures have a very low probability of successfully finding the optimal parameter sets. Next, the performance of three existing global search procedures are evaluated on the model SIXPAR. Finally, a powerful new global optimization procedure is presented, entitled the shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA) method, which was able to consistently locate the global optimum of the SIXPAR model, and appears to be capable of efficiently and effectively solving the CRR model optimization problem.},

Experience with the method has indicated that the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm are influenced by the choice of the algorithmic parameters. This paper first reviews the essential concepts of the SCE-UA method and then presents the results of several experimental studies in which the National Weather Service river forecast system-soil moisture accounting (NWSRFS-SMA) model, used by the National Weather Service for river and flood forecasting, was calibrated using different algorithmic parameter setups. On the basis of these results, the recommended values for the algorithmic parameters are given. These values should also help to provide guidelines for other users of the SCE-UA method.},

  abstract = {Snowmelt runoff in the spring is an important component in regional hydrologic systems in the northern United States and Canada, having a vital influence on water resources. In northern latitude rivers, snowmelt runoff provides a considerable volume of freshwater to drive circulation in the Arctic Ocean. This project defines and analyzes patterns of snow volume and discharge in major North American watersheds and determines the strength and form of the associated relationships. The results are used to develop statistical models applicable to individual watersheds, including the Yukon and Mackenzie basins in northern Canada and Alaska, the Saskatchewan basin in southern Canada, and the Missouri and upper Mississippi watersheds in the northern United States. It is shown that snow volume can predict winter and early spring discharge in all watersheds in the study region, with the best model performance in the higher-latitude Yukon and Mackenzie basins during late fall and winter accumulation. In the lower-latitude Missouri and upper Mississippi basins, despite additional influences of rain on discharge patterns, the statistical models based on snow volume were still able to estimate streamflow with percent relative error around 50\%. To improve modeled discharge estimates during peak spring runoff, additional snow cover variables, including the value and timing of peak snow volume and the duration of snowmelt, were compared with peak annual discharge during periods of intense snowmelt. Significant results were found to occur in the Yukon and Saskatchewan basins owing to the extreme sensitivity to snowmelt runoff and fast river response times.},

The length of the potential growing season in these tundra environments is increasing due to warmer temperatures and earlier spring snow melt. Here, we compare current and projected climate and ecological data from 20 Northern Hemisphere sites to identify how seasonal changes in the physical environment due to climate change will alter the seasonality of arctic and alpine ecosystems. We find that although arctic and alpine ecosystems appear similar under historical climate conditions, climate change will lead to divergent responses, particularly in the spring and fall shoulder seasons. As seasonality changes in the Arctic, plants will advance the timing of spring phenological events, which could increase plant nutrient uptake, production, and ecosystem carbon (C) gain. In alpine regions, photoperiod will constrain spring plant phenology, limiting the extent to which the growing season can lengthen, especially if decreased water availability from earlier snow melt and warmer summer temperatures lead to earlier senescence. The result could be a shorter growing season with decreased production and increased nutrient loss. These contrasting alpine and arctic ecosystem responses will have cascading effects on ecosystems, affecting community structure, biotic interactions, and biogeochemistry.},

The models that were examined include an energy balance approach (Surface Energy Balance System; SEBS), a combination-type technique (single-source Penman-Monteith; PM), a complementary method (advection-aridity; AA) and a radiation based approach (modified Priestley-Taylor; PT-JPL). Twenty FLUXNET towers were selected based upon satisfying stringent forcing data requirements and representing a wide range of biomes. These towers encompassed a number of grassland, cropland, shrubland, evergreen needleleaf forest and deciduous broadleaf forest sites. Based on the mean value of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and the root mean squared difference (RMSD), the order of overall performance of the models from best to worst were: ensemble mean of models (0.61, 64), PT-JPL (0.59, 66), SEBS (0.42, 84), PM (0.26, 105) and AA (0.18, 105) [statistics stated as (NSE, RMSD in W m(-2))]. Although PT-JPL uses a relatively simple and largely empirical formulation of the evaporative process, the technique showed improved performance compared to PM, possibly due to its partitioning of total evaporation (canopy transpiration, soil evaporation, wet canopy evaporation) and lower uncertainties in the required forcing data. The SEBS model showed low performance over tall and heterogeneous canopies, which was likely a consequence of the effects of the roughness sub-layer parameterization employed in this scheme. However, SEBS performed well overall. Relative to PT-JPL and SEBS, the PM and AA showed low performance over the majority of sites, due to their sensitivity to the parameterization of resistances. Importantly, it should be noted that no single model was consistently best across all biomes. Indeed, this outcome highlights the need for further evaluation of each model's structure and parameterizations to identify sensitivities and their appropriate application to different surface types and conditions. It is expected that the results of this study can be used to inform decisions regarding model choice for water resources and agricultural management, as well as providing insight into model selection for global flux monitoring efforts.

A single model that combines existing parameterizations of differing complexity in many different configurations to generate large ensembles of simulations is presented here. The model is driven and evaluated with data from four winters at an alpine site in France. Consideration of errors in simulations of snow mass, snow depth, albedo and surface temperature show that there is no ``best'' model, but there is a group of model configurations that give consistently good results, another group that give consistently poor results, and many configurations that give good results in some cases and poor results in others. There is no clear link between model complexity and performance, but the most consistent results come from configurations that have prognostic representations of snow density and albedo and that take some account of storage and refreezing of liquid water within the snow.},

These drivers are altering water availability in these wetlands, changing water levels or surface water extent, in some cases, beyond historical variability. Attribution of the effects of human and climate activities is usually focused on changes within the wetlands or their upstream surface and groundwater inputs. However, the reliance of wetland water availability on upwind atmospheric moisture supply is less understood. Here, we assess the vulnerability of 40 Ramsar wetlands to precipitation changes caused by land use and hydroclimatic change occurring in their upwind moisture-supplying regions. We use moisture flows from a Lagrangian tracking model, atmospheric reanalysis data, and historical land use change (LUC) data to assess and quantify these changes. Our analyses show that historical LUC has decreased precipitation and terrestrial moisture recycling in most wetland hydrological basins, decreasing surface water availability (precipitation minus evaporation). The most substantial effects on wetland water availability occurred in the tropic subtropical regions of Central Europe and Asia. Overall, we found wetlands in Central Asia and South America to be the most vulnerable by a combination of LUC-driven effects on runoff, high terrestrial precipitation recycling, and recent decreases in surface water availability. This study stresses the need to incorporate upwind effects of land use changes in the restoration, management, and conservation of the world's wetlands.},

This study evaluates the performance of historical simulation runs of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) in capturing spatial patterns and temporal variations observed over the PTP region for mean and extreme temperatures. In addition, projected changes in temperatures under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) are also reported. Four indices were used to characterize changes in temperature extremes: the annual maximum value of daily maximum temperature (TXx), the annual minimum value of daily minimum temperature (TNn), and indices for the percentage of warm days (TX90p) and warm nights (TN90p). Results indicate that most CMIP6 models generally capture the characteristics of the observed mean and extreme temperatures over the PTP region, but there still are slight cold biases in the Tibetan Plateau. Future changes of mean and extreme temperatures demonstrate that a strong increase will occur for the entire PTP region during the twenty-first century under all four SSP scenarios. Between 2015 and 2099, ensemble area-averaged annual mean temperatures are projected to increase by 1.24 degrees C/100 year, 3.28 degrees C/100 year, 5.57 degrees C/100 year, and 7.40 degrees C/100 year for the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively. For TXx and TNn, the most intense warming is projected in Central Asia. The greatest number of projected TX90p and TN90p will occur in the Southeast Asia and Tibetan Plateau, respectively.},

  abstract = {A station observation-based global land monthly mean surface air temperature dataset at 0.5 x 0.5 latitude-longitude resolution for the period from 1948 to the present was developed recently at the Climate Prediction Center, National Centers for Environmental Prediction. This data set is different from some existing surface air temperature data sets in: (2) using a combination of two large individual data sets of station observations collected from the Global Historical Climatology Network version 2 and the Climate Anomaly Monitoring System (GHCN + CAMS), so it can be regularly updated in near real time with plenty of stations and ( 2) some unique interpolation methods, such as the anomaly interpolation approach with spatially-temporally varying temperature lapse rates derived from the observation-based Reanalysis for topographic adjustment. When compared with several existing observation-based land surface air temperature data sets, the preliminary results show that the quality of this new GHCN + CAMS land surface air temperature analysis is reasonably good and the new data set can capture most common temporal-spatial features in the observed climatology and anomaly fields over both regional and global domains. The study also reveals that there are clear biases between the observed surface air temperature and the existing Reanalysis data sets, and they vary in space and seasons. Therefore the Reanalysis 2 m temperature data sets may not be suitable for model forcing and validation. The GHCN + CAMS data set will be mainly used as one of land surface meteorological forcing inputs to derive other land surface variables, such as soil moisture, evaporation, surface runoff, snow accumulation and snow melt, etc. As a byproduct, this monthly mean surface air temperature data set can also be applied to monitor surface air temperature variations over global land routinely or to verify the performance of model simulation and prediction.},

  abstract = {Hydrological regimes of alpine rivers are highly sensitive to climate variability/change. Temperature and precipitation variability and its effects on streamflow in the upstream regions of the Lancang-Mekong River (LMR) and Nu-Salween River (NSR) are examined in this study based on long-term observational data from 16 meteorological stations and 2 hydrological stations between the 1950s and 2010. This study employs the Mann-Kendall nonparametric test, together with the trend-free prewhitening (TFPW) approach to test trends and the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) method to detect abrupt changes in the hydrometeorological time series. The relations between air temperature, precipitation, and streamflow trends are assessed using random forest regression. The results show significant climate warming and related prevalent positive precipitation trends both at the annual and seasonal scale. A substantial precipitation increase paralleling climate warming, especially in spring, was also observed. However, no consistent abrupt change in meteorological time series was found. The increasing trends of streamflow with climate warming are seen both for the outlets of the LMR and NSR upstream regions, with the abrupt changes occurring in the mid-1960s and the late 1990s, respectively. The relation of streamflow to annual and wet season precipitation is pronounced, especially for the upstream region of the LMR with a percent variance explained of more than 65\%. However, the relatively minor linkage of streamflow to air temperature and dry season precipitation may be confounded by the climate warming-driven changes in snowpack, permafrost, glacier, and evapotranspiration. These results could provide further a reference for the regional water resources management under climate change scenarios.},

  abstract = {The Tarim River is the largest inland river of China and a major water resource to the vast arid region in northwest China. For its four major headstreams, which contribute 98\% of the Tarim River's streamflow, we investigated the dynamics of baseflow in the past 50 years. The digital filtering method was used to separate baseflow from surface flow, after which the baseflow index (BFI) was calculated and analyzed. The major findings of this study include (1) Baseflows of the four headstreams have increased considerably over the past 50 years. The large baseflow index (BFI) usually occurred in the wet years but the change rate was irregular, because of the increasing recharge from snow and glacial meltwater. (2) The annual baseflow variation of the four headstreams appeared to have cycles of 3-5 years, 10-14 years, and 25 years. (3) The baseflow and BFI showed obvious seasonal variation: The lowest baseflow and BFI typically occurred in December and January, and both increased gradually until the maximums reached in August or July. (4) The responses of runoff and baseflow to climatic factors were different. Precipitation possessed a great impact on runoff, whereas temperature possessed a great impact on baseflow. Baseflow is an important source to the Tarim River, and is affected by the increasing snow and glaciers melt as a result of temperature rise. For the four headstreams, we identified temperature thresholds in the time series of BFI and calculated regression relationships between temperature and BFI in the past 50 years. The thresholds and the regression relationships would help to assess and predict the impact of climate change on headwater inflow to the Tarim River. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Most conventional hydrological time series models, used for forecasting or synthetic data generation, are based on the stationary hypothesis. Hydrologic variables such as surface runoff discharge exhibit non-stationary behavior due to the effects of climate change or human activities. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed to analyze the uncertainty of the number and location of breakpoints in runoff time series. The non-stationary runoff time series is simulated by segmenting the series into stationary pieces, which follow an Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) process, based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The length of each piece and the order of the piecewise ARMA model are optimized using the Genetic Algorithm (GA). Several runoff time series with variable lengths are generated based on the observed data and the probability distribution function(s) (PDFs) of breakpoint location(s) are constructed. An optimal set of breakpoint locations are found for each generated runoff time series by minimizing the objective function based on the MDL. Finally, the PDF(s) of breakpoint location(s) is (are) constructed using the results of the mentioned optimization model. To evaluate the proposed methodology, it is applied to the case study of Zayandehrud River in Iran. According to the obtained breakpoint PDF for the runoff time series, three breakpoints around years of 1987, 1996 and 2006 are identified. The results are analyzed by investigating the time series of agricultural lands derived using remote sensing data and studying the impacts of interbasin water transfer projects implemented in the study area. Overall, investigating human-induced changes in the study area confirms the obtained shape of the PDF of runoff breakpoint and shows the good performance of the developed method for finding the number and location of breakpoints in the runoff time series.},

  abstract = {The hydrological cycle is receiving increasing attention both as an essential natural resource for humans and ecosystems and as a critical component controlling the earth's climate system. Better understanding of the water cycle and its interaction with changing climate will require improved monitoring of the various water fluxes and storages in hydrological processes. River discharge is a unique component reflecting an integrated hydrological signal over larger regions. Existing in situ monitoring solutions to monitor discharge are often considered too expensive and the difficulties in data sharing are viewed as insurmountable obstacles, which has led to growing interest in finding an alternative. This paper argues that in situ monitoring is far less expensive than claimed and the obstacles are not necessarily as insurmountable as often stated and a conscious effort to revitalize in situ monitoring will be needed. This paper demonstrates that there is no substitute for in situ discharge monitoring, but there should be a synergy between in situ monitoring and remote sensing since they are truly complementary. This paper primarily focuses on river discharge, but the conclusions are relevant for a host of other earth observations (particularly water quality) that would greatly benefit from a reconsidered balance between in situ and remote sensing observations.},

  abstract = {In this study, we investigate the different impacts of El Ni{\~n}o and El Ni{\~n}o Modoki on China rainfall in their decaying phases. During spring, in the decaying year of El Ni{\~n}o events, there are positive rainfall anomalies south of the Yangtze River, whereas no obvious rainfall signals are found in the same season for the decaying El Ni{\~n}o Modoki. In the subsequent summer season, the wet signal south of the Yangtze River associated with El Ni{\~n}o continues, while suppressed rainfall now appears in the northern Yangtze--Huaihe River region. In contrast, the rainfall is above normal in the region from the Huaihe River to the Yellow River, and below normal in southern China during the summer of the decaying El Ni{\~n}o Modoki events. The distinct China rainfall anomaly is mainly attributed to the difference between the evolution and location of the anomalous western North Pacific (WNP) anti-cyclone associated with El Ni{\~n}o and El Ni{\~n}o Modoki events. For the case of El Ni{\~n}o, the WNP anti-cyclone brings plentiful moisture to southern China; meanwhile it shifts the ridge of sub-tropical high westward in both spring and summer. These tend to induce positive rainfall anomalies in the southern Chinese region. In contrast, due to fast decaying of El Ni{\~n}o Modoki, the anomalous WNP anti-cyclone becomes weak so that there are no significant rainfall anomalies in China. In summer, however, the WNP anti-cyclone re-invigorates possibly associated with a subsequent developing La Ni{\~n}a and extends more northwestward towards the inland region, compared to its El Ni{\~n}o counterpart. The anomalous moisture transport and sub-tropical high activity associated with this WNP anti-cyclone result in different summer rainfall anomalies in China.

The algorithms applied were: Random Forest, Earth and linear model. The response variables were the three types of minimum streamflow (Q7.10, Q95 and Q90), besides the long-term average streamflow (Qmld). The database involved 76 environmental covariates related to morphometry, topography, climate, land use and cover, and surface conditions. The elimination of covariates was performed using two processes: Pearson's correlation analysis and importance analysis by Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). To validate the models, the following statistical metrics were used: Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE), percent bias (PBIAS), Willmott's index of agreement (d), coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and relative error (RE). The linear model was unsatisfactory for all response variables. The results show that nonlinear models performed well, and their covariate of greatest predictive importance was flow equivalent to the precipitated volume, considering the subtraction of an abstraction factor of 750~mm (Peq750). Generally, the Random Forest and Earth models showed similar performances and great ability to predict the minimum streamflow and long-term average streamflow assessed, constituting powerful and promising alternatives for the streamflow regionalization in support to the management and integrated planning of water resources at the level of river basins.},

Such contributions can be estimated via hydrological models, provided that the modeling adequately accounts for snow and glacier melt, as well as rainfall runoff. We present a multiple data set calibration approach to estimate runoff composition using hydrological models with three levels of complexity. For this purpose, the code of the conceptual runoff model HBV-light was enhanced to allow calibration and validation of simulations against glacier mass balances, satellite-derived snow cover area and measured discharge. Three levels of complexity of the model were applied to glacierized catchments in Switzerland, ranging from 39 to 103 km2. The results indicate that all three observational data sets are reproduced adequately by the model, allowing an accurate estimation of the runoff composition in the three mountain streams. However, calibration against only runoff leads to unrealistic snow and glacier melt rates. Based on these results, we recommend using all three observational data sets in order to constrain model parameters and compute snow, glacier, and rain contributions. Finally, based on the comparison of model performance of different complexities, we postulate that the availability and use of different data sets to calibrate hydrological models might be more important than model complexity to achieve realistic estimations of runoff composition.},

  abstract = {Poorly monitored river flows in many regions of the world have been hindering our ability to accurately estimate global water budgets as well as the variability of the global water cycle. In situ gauging sites, as well as a number of satellite-based systems, make observations of river discharge throughout the globe; however, these observations are often sparse due to, for example, the sampling frequencies of sensors or a lack of reporting. Recently, efforts have been made to develop methods to integrate these discrete observations to gain a better understanding of the underlying processes. This paper presents an application of a fixed interval Kalman smoother-based model, called inverse streamflow routing (ISR), to generate spatially and temporally continuous river discharge fields from discrete observations. The method propagates the observed information across all reachable parts of the river network (up/downstream from gauging point) and all reachable times (before/after observation time) using a two-sweep procedure that first propagates information backward in time to the furthest upstream locations (inverse routing) and then propagates it forward in time to the furthest downstream locations (forward routing). The ISR methodology advances prediction of streamflow in ungauged basins by accounting for a physical representation of the river system that is not generally handled explicitly in more-commonly applied statistically based models. The key advantages of this approach are that it (1) maintains all the physical consistencies embodied by a diffusive wave routing model (flow confluence relationships on the river network and the resulting mass balance, wave velocity, and diffusivity), (2) updates the lateral influx (runoff) at the pixel level (furthest upstream) to guarantee exhaustive propagation of observed information, and (3) works both with a first guess of initial river discharge conditions from a routing model (assimilation) and without a first guess (pure interpolation of observations). Two sets of experiments are carried out under idealized conditions and under real-world conditions provided by United States Geological Survey (USGS) observations. Results show that the method can effectively reproduce the spatial and temporal dynamics of river discharge in each of the experiments presented. The performance is driven by the density of the gauge network as well as the quality of the data being assimilated. We find that when assimilating the actual USGS observations, the performance decreases relative to our idealized scenario; however, we are still able to produce an improved discharge product at each validation site. With further testing, as well as global application, ISR may prove to be a useful method for extending our current network of global river discharge observations.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Surface climate in Europe is changing and patterns in trends have been found to vary at sub-seasonal scales. This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of these changes across space and time by analysing to what degree observed climatic trends can be attributed to changes in synoptic atmospheric circulation. The relative importance of synoptic circulation changes (i.e. trends in synoptic type frequencies) as opposed to trends in the hydrothermal properties of synoptic types (within-type trends) on precipitation and temperature trends in Europe is assessed on a monthly basis. The study is based on mapping spatial and temporal trend patterns and their variability at a relatively high resolution (0.5{$^\circ$} {\texttimes} 0.5{$^\circ$}; monthly) across Europe. Gridded precipitation and temperature data (1963--2001) originate from the Watch Forcing Data set and synoptic types are defined by the objective SynopVis Grosswetterlagen (SVG). During the study period, relatively high influence of synoptic circulation changes are found from January to March, contributing to wetting trends in northern Europe and drying in the south. Simultaneously, particularly dry synoptic types get warmer first in south-western Europe in November and/or December and affect most of Europe in March and/or April. Strong influence of synoptic circulation changes is again found in June and August. In general, changes in synoptic circulation has a stronger effect on climate trends in north-western Europe than in the south-east. The exact locations of the strongest influence of synoptic circulation changes vary with the time of year and to some degree between precipitation and temperature. Throughout the year and across the whole of Europe, precipitation and temperature trends are caused by a combination of synoptic circulation changes and within-type changes with their relative influence varying between regions, months and climate variables.},

  abstract = {Runoff in the United States is changing, and this study finds that the measured change is dependent on the geographic region and varies seasonally. Specifically, observed annual total runoff had an insignificant increasing trend in the US between 1950 and 2010, but this insignificance was due to regional heterogeneity with both significant and insignificant increases in the eastern, northern, and southern US, and a greater significant decrease in the western US. Trends for seasonal mean runoff also differed across regions. By region, the season with the largest observed trend was autumn for the east (positive), spring for the north (positive), winter for the south (positive), winter for the west (negative), and autumn for the US as a whole (positive). Based on the detection and attribution analysis using gridded WaterWatch runoff observations along with semi-factorial land surface model simulations from the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP), we found that while the roles of CO2 concentration, nitrogen deposition, and land use and land cover were inconsistent regionally and seasonally, the effect of climatic variations was detected for all regions and seasons, and the change in runoff could be attributed to climate change in summer and autumn in the south and in autumn in the west. We also found that the climate-only and historical transient simulations consistently underestimated the runoff trends, possibly due to precipitation bias in the MsTMIP driver or within the models themselves.},

The CAMELS-AUS catchments have been monitored for decades (more than 85\% have streamflow records longer than 40 years) and are relatively free of large-scale changes, such as significant changes in land use. Rating curve uncertainty estimates are provided for most (75 \%) of the catchments, and multiple atmospheric datasets are included, offering insights into forcing uncertainty. This dataset allows users globally to freely access catchment data drawn from Australia's unique hydroclimatology, particularly notable for its large interannual variability. Combined with arid catchment data from the CAMELS datasets for the USA and Chile, CAMELS-AUS constitutes an unprecedented resource for the study of arid-zone hydrology.

  abstract = {River flow statistics are expected to change as a result of increasing atmospheric CO2 but uncertainty in Earth system model projections is high. While this is partly driven by changing precipitation, with well-known Earth system model uncertainties, here we show that the influence of plant stomatal conductance feedbacks can cause equally large changes in regional flood extremes and even act as the main control on future low latitude streamflow. Over most tropical land masses, modern climate predictions suggest that plant physiological effects will boost streamflow, overwhelming opposing effects of soil drying driven by the effects of CO2 on atmospheric radiation, warming and rainfall redistribution. The relatively unknown uncertainties in representing eco-physiological processes must therefore be better constrained in land-surface models. To this end, we identify a distinct plant physiological fingerprint on annual peak, low and mean discharge throughout the tropics and identify river basins where physiological responses dominate radiative responses to rising CO2 in modern climate projections.},

  abstract = {Annual export of 11 major and trace solutes for the Yukon River is found to be accurately determined based on summing 42 tributary contributions. These findings provide the first published estimates of tributary specific distribution of solutes within the Yukon River basin. First, we show that annual discharge of the Yukon River can be computed by summing calculated annual discharges from 42 tributaries. Annual discharge for the tributaries is calculated from the basin area and average annual precipitation over that area using a previously published regional regression equation. Based on tributary inputs, we estimate an average annual discharge for the Yukon River of 210 km3 year--1. This value is within 1\% of the average measured annual discharge at the U.S. Geological Survey gaging station near the river terminus at Pilot Station, AK, for water years 2001 through 2005. Next, annual loads for 11 solutes are determined by combining annual discharge with point measurements of solute concentrations in tributary river water. Based on the sum of solutes in tributary water, we find that the Yukon River discharges approximately 33 million metric tons of dissolved solids each year at Pilot Station. Discharged solutes are dominated by cations calcium and magnesium (5.65 {\^A} 109 and 1.42 {\^A} 109 g year--1) and anions bicarbonate and sulphate (17.3 {\^A} 109 and 5.40 {\^A} 109 g year--1). These loads compare well with loads calculated independently at the three continuous gaging stations along the Yukon River. These findings show how annual solute yields vary throughout a major subarctic river basin and that accurate estimates of total river export can be determined from calculated tributary contributions.

  abstract = {This study extends the single parameter precipitation elasticity of streamflow index into a two parameter climate elasticity index, as a function of both precipitation and temperature, in order to assess climatic effects on annual streamflow. Application of the proposed index to two basins indicates that the single parameter precipitation elasticity index may give a general relationship between precipitation and streamflow in some cases, but that it cannot reflect the complicated non-linear relationship among streamflow, precipitation and temperature. For example, for the Spokane River basin the climate elasticity of streamflow index varies from 2.4 to 0.2, for a precipitation increase of 20\%, as temperature varies from 1{$^\circ$}C lower to 1.8{$^\circ$}C higher than the long term mean. Thus a 20\% precipitation increase may result in a streamflow increase of 48\% if the temperature is 1{$^\circ$}C lower but only a 4\% increase if the temperature is 1.8{$^\circ$}C higher than the long-term mean. The proposed method can be applied to other basins to assess potential climate change effects on annual streamflow. The results of the two case studies can inform planning of long-term basin water management strategies taking into account global change scenarios.},

The models range from a simple degree-day model, based solely on air temperature, to more-sophisticated models, including the full shortwave radiation balance. In addition to the empirical models, the performance of a physically based energy-balance (EB) model is examined. The melt models are coupled to an accumulation and a surface evolution model and applied in a distributed manner to Rhonegletscher, Switzerland, over the period 1929-2012 at hourly resolution. For calibration, seasonal mass-balance measurements (2006-12) are used. Decadal ice volume changes for six periods in the years 1929-2012 serve for model validation. Over the period 2006-12, there are almost no differences in performance between the models, except for EB, which is less consistent with observations, likely due to lack of meteorological in situ data. However, simulations over the long term (1929-2012) reveal that models which include a separate term for shortwave radiation agree best with the observed ice volume changes, indicating that their melt relationships are robust in time and thus suitable for long-term modelling, in contrast to more empirical approaches that are oversensitive to temperature fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Water processes in the Tienshan Mountains have undergone great changes under the impacts of climate warming and human activities. Here, based on the Budyko framework, we investigated the respective contributions of climate change and human activities to decadal runoff changes (1982-2014) in two contrary watersheds, i.e., the humid Kashi watershed in the Yili River valley and the arid Boertala watershed in the Ebinur Lake basin, in the Tienshan Mountains, where closing the water balance is difficult due to the scarcity of precipitation gauges. To achieve closure of the decadal water balance of the study watersheds, we estimated evapotranspiration from a complementary relationship model and snow/ice melt using the degree-day method with the remote sensing snow cover product. We found that the increase of rainfall (+61.6 mm) and snow/ice melt (+57.3 mm) dominated the increase of runoff (+87.2 mm, from 398.2 mm in 1982-1992 to 485.4 mm in 1993-2014) in the Kashi watershed, contributing 47.1 mm (54.8\%) and 43.8 mm (51.0\%), respectively, to the increase of runoff. Unlike the Kashi watershed, human activities contributed -13.8 mm (-103.7\%) to the runoff (+13.9 mm, from 61.4 mm in 1982-1997 to 75.3 mm in 1998-2014) in the Boertala watershed. Most of the increase in rainfall (+62.5 mm) and snow/ice melt (+13.6 mm) was consumed by the increase of ET (+64.0 mm) instead of runoff. Further analysis showed that most of the increases in snow/ice melt and ET were contributed from the high ({$>$}2500 m) and low ({$<$}1500 m) elevation regions, respectively. Snowmelt showed a decreasing trend in low elevation regions. Our study highlighted the importance of snow/ice melt and ET in understanding decadal changes in runoff in the Tienshan Mountains.},

  abstract = {The Budyko models provide a transparent framework for analyzing climate-catchment interactions and therefore have been widely used to quantify the role of vegetation influencing the partitioning of precipitation (P) into evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff (R) at watershed to regional scales under a changing environment. This study provides a thorough review of the use of Budyko models for answering modern hydrological questions including the relation between vegetation dynamic and catchment ET (or runoff) and climate change impacts on water balances. Our synthesis suggests that: When vegetation structure and rooting characteristics are included, the Budyko models can explain over 90\% of global spatial variations in ET. Budyko models showed that although climate dominates the catchment water balance, forest cover change also accounts for 30.7\% +/- 22.5\% change in annual runoff in watersheds globally. Vegetation in watersheds with a low water retention capacity tends to play a more important role than climate change. Vegetation effects on annual runoff are most pronounced in water-limited regions and large scale revegetation can contribute 60\% of the total observed change in the annual runoff. Budyko models can be used to study the joint impacts of climate seasonality (rainfall frequency and the time lag between maximum precipitation and net radiation) and vegetation on interannual variations in water balances. We conclude that vegetation dynamics have been successfully incorporated into the Budyko framework in the past two decades. The Budyko framework can be extended to provide insights into the interactions between climate, hydrology, and ecology. Uses of the Budyko framework for studying the hydrological effects of vegetation dynamics under a changing climate require analytical derivations of the models that incorporate climate-vegetation coevolution procedures.},

  abstract = {Glacier retreat caused by global warming alters the hydrological regime and poses far-reaching challenges to water resources and nature conservation of the headwater of Yangtze River, and its vast downstream regions with dense population. However, there is still lack of a robust modeling framework of the "climate-glacier-streamflow" in this water tower region, to project the future changes of glacier mass balance, glacier geometry, and the consequent impacts on runoff. Moreover, it is imperative to use the state-of-the-art sixth phase Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) to assess glacio-hydrology variations in future. In this study, we coupled a glacio-hydrological model (FLEXG) with a glacier retreat method (Delta h-parameterization) to simulate glacio-hydrological processes in the Dongkemadi Glacier (over 5155 m.a.s.l), which has the longest continuous glacio-hydrology observation on the headwater of Yangtze River. The FLEXG-Delta h model was forced with in-situ observed meteorological data, radar ice thickness, remote sensing topography and land cover data, and validated by measured runoff. The results showed that the model was capable to simulate hydrological processes in this glacierized basin, with Kling-Gupta efficiency (I-KGE) of daily runoff simulation 0.88 in calibration and 0.70 in validation. Then, forcing by the bias-corrected meteorological forcing from the eight latest CMIP6 Earth system models under two climate scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5), we assessed the impact of future climate change on glacier response and its hydrological effects. The results showed that, to the end of simulation in 2100, the volume of the Dongkemadi Glacier would continuously retreat. For the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, the glacier volume will decrease by 8.7 x 10(8) m(3) (74\%) and 10.8 x 10(8) m(3) (92\%) respectively in 2100. The glacier runoff will increase and reach to peak water around 2060 to 2085, after this tipping point water resources will likely decrease. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Alpine ecosystem in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is vulnerable to climate change. To quantify the climate change impacts on alpine ecosystems, we simulated the vegetation distribution and net primary production in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau for three future periods (2020s, 2050s and 2080s) using climate projection for RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways) RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The modified Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ model) was parameter and test to make it applicable to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Climate projections that were applied to LPJ model in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau showed trends toward warmer and wetter conditions. Results based on climate projections indicated changes from 1.3 degrees C to 4.2 degrees C in annual temperature and changes from 2\% to 5\% in annual precipitation. The main impacts on vegetation ddistribution was increase in the area of forests and shrubs, decrease in alpine meadows which mainly replaced by shrubs which dominated the eastern plateau, and expanding in alpine steppes to the northwest dominated the western and northern plateau. The NPP was projected to increase by 79\% and 134\% under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The projected NPP generally increased about 200 g C.m(-2) .yr(-1) in most parts of the plateau with a gradual increase from the eastern to the western region of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau at the end of this century.

Under seasonal and decadal air temperature variations, permafrost temperature changes control the exchanges between groundwater and surface water. A coupled heat transport and groundwater flow model, SUTRA, was modified to simulate groundwater flow and heat transport in the subsurface containing permafrost. The northern central Tibet Plateau was used as an example of model application. Modeling results show that in a yearly cycle, groundwater flow occurs in the active layer from May to October. Maximum groundwater discharge to the surface lags the maximum subsurface temperature by two months. Under an increasing air temperature scenario of 3{$^\circ$}C per 100 years, over the initial 40-year period, the active layer thickness can increase by three-fold. Annual groundwater discharge to the surface can experience a similar three-fold increase in the same period. An implication of these modeling results is that with increased warming there will be more groundwater flow in the active layer and therefore increased groundwater discharge to rivers. However, this finding only holds if sufficient upgradient water is available to replenish the increased discharge. Otherwise, there will be an overall lowering of the water table in the recharge portion of the catchment.},

Based on the CRU TS2.1 climatology, total global Q rose over 1901--2002 (trend, 30.8 km3 a-2, equaling 7.7\%), due primarily to increasing precipitation (individual effect, +24.7 km3 a-2). Global warming (-3.1), rising CO2 (+4.4), land cover changes (+5.9) and irrigation (-1.1) also had discernible effects. However, sign and magnitude of trends exhibited pronounced decadal variability and differed among precipitation forcing datasets. Since recent trends in these and other drivers of Q are mainly anthropogenic, we conclude that humans exert an increasing influence on the global water cycle.},

  abstract = {Evapotranspiration integrates energy and mass transfer between the Earth's surface and atmosphere and is the most active mechanism linking the atmosphere, hydrosphsophere, lithosphere and biosphere. This study focuses on the fine resolution modeling and projection of spatially distributed potential evapotranspiration on the large catchment scale as response to climate change. Six potential evapotranspiration designed algorithms, systematically selected based on a structured criteria and data availability, have been applied and then validated to long-term mean monthly data for the Shannon River catchment with a 50 m(2) cell size. The best validated algorithm was therefore applied to evaluate the possible effect of future climate change on potential evapotranspiration rates. Spatially distributed potential evapotranspiration projections have been modeled based on climate change projections from multi-GCM ensembles for three future time intervals (2020, 2050 and 2080) using a range of different Representative Concentration Pathways producing four scenarios for each time interval. Finally, seasonal results have been compared to baseline results to evaluate the impact of climate change on the potential evapotranspiration and there for on the catchment dynamical water balance. The results present evidence that the modeled climate change scenarios would have a significant impact on the future potential evapotranspiration rates. All the simulated scenarios predicted an increase in potential evapotranspiration for each modeled future time interval, which would significantly affect the dynamical catchment water balance. This study addresses the gap in the literature of using GIS-based algorithms to model fine-scale spatially distributed potential evapotranspiration on the large catchment systems based on climatological observations and simulations in different climatological zones. Providing fine-scale potential evapotranspiration data is very crucial to assess the dynamical catchment water balance to setup management scenarios for the water abstractions. This study illustrates a transferable systematic method to design GIS-based algorithms to simulate spatially distributed potential evapotranspiration on the large catchment systems.},

  abstract = {River discharge is an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) and is one of the best monitored components of the terrestrial water cycle. Nonetheless, gauging stations are distributed unevenly around the world, leaving many white spaces on global freshwater resources maps. Here, we use a machine learning algorithm and historical weather data to upscale sparse in situ river discharge measurements. We provide a global reanalysis of monthly runoff rates for periods covering decades to the past century at a resolution of 0.5 degrees (about 55 km), and with up to 525 ensemble members based on 21 different atmospheric forcing data sets. This global runoff reconstruction, named Global RUNoff ENSEMBLE (G-RUN ENSEMBLE), is evaluated using independent observations from large river basins and benchmarked against other publicly available runoff data sets over the period 1981-2010. The accuracy of the data set is evaluated on observed river flow from basins not used for model calibration and is found to compare favorably against state-of-the-art global hydrological model simulations. The G-RUN ENSEMBLE estimates the global mean runoff volume to range between 3.2 x 10(4) and 3.8 x 10(4) km(3) yr(-1). This publicly available data set (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12794075) has a wide range of applications, including regional water resources assessments, climate change attribution studies, hydro-climatic process studies as well as the evaluation, calibration and refinement of global hydrological models. Plain Language Summary River discharge is related to numerous impacts associated with floods and droughts. It is relatively well observed in North America and Europe, but no global data sets of monthly river discharge accounting for the uncertainty in historical hydrometeorological conditions have been available so far. Here we derive a new global 119-year-long monthly data set of river discharge at 0.5 degrees-resolution (ca. 55 km) using a machine learning algorithm and historical weather data in combination with local discharge data. This new reconstruction, the G-RUN ENSEMBLE, is publicly available (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12794075). It is relevant for numerous water cycle applications.},

This study introduces a global gridded monthly reconstruction of runoff covering the period from 1902 to 2014. In situ streamflow observations are used to train a machine learning algorithm that predicts monthly runoff rates based on antecedent precipitation and temperature from an atmospheric reanalysis. The accuracy of this reconstruction is assessed with cross-validation and compared with an independent set of discharge observations for large river basins. The presented dataset agrees on average better with the streamflow observations than an ensemble of 13 state-of-the art global hydrological model runoff simulations. We estimate a global long-term mean runoff of 38 452 km3 yr-1 in agreement with previous assessments. The temporal coverage of the reconstruction offers an unprecedented view on large-scale features of runoff variability in regions with limited data coverage, making it an ideal candidate for large-scale hydro-climatic process studies, water resource assessments, and evaluating and refining existing hydrological models. The paper closes with example applications fostering the understanding of global freshwater dynamics, interannual variability, drought propagation and the response of runoff to atmospheric teleconnections.

Quantile regression is performed to interpret how wind speed changed across different percentiles.

  abstract = {We revisit the issue of the response of precipitation characteristics to global warming based on analyses of global and regional climate model projections for the 21st century. The prevailing response we identify can be summarized as follows: increase in the intensity of precipitation events and extremes, with the occurrence of events of "unprecedented" magnitude, i.e., a magnitude not found in the present-day climate; decrease in the number of light precipitation events and in wet spell lengths; and increase in the number of dry days and dry spell lengths. This response, which is mostly consistent across the models we analyzed, is tied to the difference between precipitation intensity responding to increases in local humidity conditions and circulations, especially for heavy and extreme events, and mean precipitation responding to slower increases in global evaporation. These changes in hydroclimatic characteristics have multiple and important impacts on the Earth's hydrologic cycle and on a variety of sectors. As examples we investigate effects on potential stress due to increases in dry and wet extremes, changes in precipitation interannual variability, and changes in the potential predictability of precipitation events. We also stress how the understanding of the hydroclimatic response to global warming can provide important insights into the fundamental behavior of precipitation processes, most noticeably tropical convection.},

Such tools are useful to inform local and region-specific water management and flood forecasting related activities. Two powerful deep-learning variants of the Recurrent Neural Network were investigated, namely the standard and attention-based encoder-decoder long short-term memory (LSTM) models. Both models were forced with past hydro-meteorological states and daily meteorological data with a look-back time window of several days. These models were tested for 10 different watersheds from the Ottawa River watershed, located within the Great Lakes Saint-Lawrence region of Canada, an economic powerhouse of the country. The results of training and testing phases suggest that both models are able to simulate overall hydrograph patterns well when compared to observational records. Between the two models, the attention model significantly outperforms the standard model in all watersheds, suggesting the importance and usefulness of the attention mechanism in ML architectures, not well explored for hydrological applications. The mean performance accuracy of the attention model on unseen data, when assessed in terms of mean Nash--Sutcliffe Efficiency and Kling-Gupta Efficiency is, respectively, found to be 0.985 and 0.954 for these watersheds. Streamflow forecasts with lead times of up to 5~days with the attention model demonstrate overall skillful performance with well above the benchmark accuracy of 70\%. The results of the study suggest that the encoder--decoder LSTM, with attention mechanism, is a powerful modelling choice for developing streamflow forecasting systems for Canadian watersheds.},

In this paper, a multiobjective adaptive surrogate modeling-based optimization (MO-ASMO) algorithm is introduced that aims to reduce computational cost while maintaining optimization effectiveness. Geophysical dynamic models usually have a prior parameterization scheme derived from the physical processes involved, and our goal is to improve all of the objectives by parameter calibration. In this study, we developed a method for directing the search processes toward the region that can improve all of the objectives simultaneously. We tested the MO-ASMO algorithm against NSGA-II and SUMO with 13 test functions and a land surface model - the Common Land Model (CoLM).

Relative changes in simulated mean annual runoff (MAR) and four indicators of high and low extreme flows are compared between the two ensembles. The ensemble median values of changes in runoff with three different scenarios of global-mean warming (1, 2 and 3~{$^\circ$}C above pre-industrial levels) are generally similar between the two ensembles, although the ensemble spread is often larger for the Glob-HM ensemble. In addition the ensemble spread is normally larger than the difference between the two ensemble medians. Whilst we find compelling evidence for projected runoff changes for the Rhine (decrease), Tagus (decrease) and Lena (increase) with global warming, the sign and magnitude of change for the other catchments is unclear. Our model results highlight that for these three catchments in particular, global climate change mitigation, which limits global-mean temperature rise to below 2~{$^\circ$}C above preindustrial levels, could avoid some of the hydrological hazards that could be seen with higher magnitudes of global warming.},

  abstract = {Global hydrological models (GHMs) model the land surface hydrologic dynamics of continental-scale river basins. Here we describe one such GHM, the Macro-scale---Probability-Distributed Moisture model.09 (Mac-PDM.09). The model has undergone a number of revisions since it was last applied in the hydrological literature. This paper serves to provide a detailed description of the latest version of the model. The main revisions include the following: (1) the ability for the model to be run for n repetitions, which provides more robust estimates of extreme hydrological behaviour, (2) the ability of the model to use a gridded field of coefficient of variation (CV) of daily rainfall for the stochastic disaggregation of monthly precipitation to daily precipitation, and (3) the model can now be forced with daily input climate data as well as monthly input climate data. We demonstrate the effects that each of these three revisions has on simulated runoff relative to before the revisions were applied. Importantly, we show that when Mac-PDM.09 is forced with monthly input data, it results in a negative runoff bias relative to when daily forcings are applied, for regions of the globe where the day-to-day variability in relative humidity is high. The runoff bias can be up to - 80\% for a small selection of catchments but the absolute magnitude of the bias may be small. As such, we recommend future applications of Mac-PDM.09 that use monthly climate forcings acknowledge the bias as a limitation of the model. The performance of Mac-PDM.09 is evaluated by validating simulated runoff against observed runoff for 50 catchments. We also present a sensitivity analysis that demonstrates that simulated runoff is considerably more sensitive to method of PE calculation than to perturbations in soil moisture and field capacity parameters.

CNRD v1.0 was generated using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. A comprehensive parameter uncertainty analysis framework incorporating parameter sensitivity analysis, optimization, and regionalization with 200 natural or near-natural gauge catchments was used to train the VIC model. Overall, the results show well-calibrated parameters for most gauged catchments except arid and semiarid areas, and the skill scores present high values for all catchments. For the pseudo-/test-ungauged catchments, the model parameters estimated by the multiscale parameter regionalization technique offer the best regionalization solution. CNRD v1.0 is the first free public dataset of gridded natural runoff estimated using a comprehensive model parameter uncertainty analysis framework for China. These results indicate that CNRD v1.0 has high potential for application to long-term hydrological and climate studies in China and to improve international runoff databases for global-scale studies.},

  abstract = {Streamflow sensitivity to climate change is an important indicator for evaluating the effects of climate change on terrestrial water. This study analyzed the spatial pattern and seasonality of streamflow sensitivity to climate change for 425 catchments across China. The results indicate that precipitation is consistently a more important contributor than temperature to streamflow variability (mean streamflow sensitivity to annual precipitation [epsilon(P,a)] = 0.92; absolute mean sensitivity to annual temperature [epsilon(T,a)] = 0.05). Meanwhile, the seasonal sensitivity evaluation found that streamflow response to precipitation change in warm seasons (mean epsilon(P,w) = 0.90) is significantly greater than in cool seasons (mean epsilon(P,c) = 0.46), but the sensitivity of streamflow to changes in temperature was stronger in cool seasons than in warm seasons. The magnitude of streamflow sensitivity to temperature in cool seasons is significantly affected by elevation (Pearson's r = 0.31, P {$<$} 0.01), which is possibly due to the increased snow and glacial melt volume of the high-elevation catchments in cool seasons. We also found that catchments with higher elevation, drier climate, less vegetation cover, and lower infiltration rates are more likely to present seasonally asymmetric precipitation sensitivity. A possible reason for this spatial pattern is that the highland and continental climate regimes generally exhibit strong precipitation seasonality, thus enhancing the asymmetry of streamflow response to seasonal precipitation change. These findings are essential to improve understanding of the impact of climate change on hydrological processes and thus for formulating adaptive water management strategies for future climate change in China. Plain Language Summary Streamflow sensitivity to climate change is an important indicator for evaluating the effects of climate change on terrestrial water. However, the response of streamflow to climate change across China is unclear, particularly the seasonality of streamflow sensitivity, and the impact factors across different hydroclimate regions remain poorly understood. This study developed a multivariate linear regression model to analyze the spatial pattern and seasonality of streamflow sensitivity to climate change for 425 catchments across China. The results indicate that precipitation is consistently a more important contributor than temperature to streamflow variability. Meanwhile, those catchments with higher elevation, dryer climate, less vegetation cover, and lower infiltration rates are more likely to present seasonally asymmetric precipitation sensitivity.},

  abstract = {Model parameter calibration is a fundamentally important stage that must be completed before applying a model to address practical problems. In this study, we describe an automatic calibration framework that combines sensitivity analysis (SA) and an adaptive surrogate modeling-based optimization (ASMO) algorithm. We use this framework to calibrate catchment-specific sensitive parameters for streamflow simulation in the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model with a 0.25{$^\circ$} spatial resolution over 10 major river basins of China from 1960 to 1979. We found that three parameters---the infiltration parameter (B) and two of the soil depth parameters (D1, D2)---are highly sensitive in most basins, while other parameter sensitivities are strongly related to the dynamic environment of the basin. Compared with directly calibrating the seven parameters recommended for the default calibration procedure, our framework not only reduced the computing time by two thirds through opting out of insensitive parameters (type I error) but also improved the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) for optimized results when it identified a missing sensitive parameter (type II error) in the case study river basins. Results show that the SA-based ASMO framework is an effective and efficient model-optimization technique for matching simulated streamflow with observations across China. The NSE for monthly streamflow ranged from 0.75 to 0.97 and from 0.71 to 0.97 during the validation and calibration periods, respectively. The calibrated parameters can be applied directly in streamflow simulations across China, and the proposed calibration framework holds important implications for relevant simulation studies in other regions.},

We founded that the precipitation decreased slightly over most of the basin; however, an increasing occurrence of extreme events was detected in the northern and eastern parts of the basin, especially for the number of very wet days and, correspondingly, how much those days contributed to total precipitation. By contrast, the mean, maximum and minimum temperature values between 1961 and 2014 showed statistically significant positive trends in almost all regions of the basin. The rate of change was greater for minimum temperature than maximum temperature, which resulted in a significant increasing trend for the number of warm nights and an overall decreasing trend in the annual mean diurnal temperature range. Generally, the magnitudes of changes in temperature were more remarkable than the magnitudes of changes in precipitation over the Songhua River Basin. If we take both precipitation and temperature changes into account, the areas sensitive to climate change during the last five decades were in the southern and central parts of the Songhua River Basin.},

The concept that dry regions dry out further, whereas wet regions become wetter as the climate warms has been proposed as a simplified summary of expected8-10 as well as observed(10-14) changes over land, although this concept is mostly based on oceanic data(8,10). Here we present an analysis of more than 300 combinations of various hydrological data sets of historical land dryness changes covering the period from 1948 to 2005. Each combination of data sets is benchmarked against an empirical relationship between evaporation, precipitation and aridity. Those combinations that perform well are used for trend analysis. We find that over about three-quarters of the global land area, robust dryness changes cannot be detected. Only 10.8\% of the global land area shows a robust 'dry gets drier, wet gets wetter' pattern, compared to 9.5\% of global land area with the opposite pattern, that is, dry gets wetter, and wet gets drier. We conclude that aridity changes over land, where the potential for direct socio-economic consequences is highest, have not followed a simple intensification of existing patterns.},

Here we extend the framework by introducing a method to specify probabilistic estimates of water availability that account for the nonlinearity of the underlying phase space. The new framework allows to evaluate the predictability of water availability that is related to varying catchment characteristics and conditional on the underlying climatic conditions. Corresponding results support the practical experience of low predictability of river runoff in transitional climates.},

  abstract = {Changes in regional water availability belong to the most crucial potential impacts of anthropogenic climate change, but are highly uncertain. It is thus of key importance for stakeholders to assess the possible implications of different global temperature thresholds on these quantities. Using a subset of climate model simulations from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), we derive here the sensitivity of regional changes in precipitation and in precipitation minus evapotranspiration to global temperature changes. The simulations span the full range of available emission scenarios, and the sensitivities are derived using a modified pattern scaling approach. The applied approach assumes linear relationships on global temperature changes while thoroughly addressing associated uncertainties via resampling methods. This allows us to assess the full distribution of the simulations in a probabilistic sense. Northern high-latitude regions display robust responses towards wetting, while subtropical regions display a tendency towards drying but with a large range of responses. Even though both internal variability and the scenario choice play an important role in the overall spread of the simulations, the uncertainty stemming from the climate model choice usually accounts for about half of the total uncertainty in most regions. We additionally assess the implications of limiting global mean temperature warming to values below (i) 2 K or (ii) 1.5 K (as stated within the 2015 Paris Agreement). We show that opting for the 1.5 K target might just slightly influence the mean response, but could substantially reduce the risk of experiencing extreme changes in regional water availability.},

For climatological averages, the Budyko framework provides a simple first-order relationship to estimate water availability represented by the ratio E / P as a function of the aridity index (Ep/P , with Ep denoting potential evaporation). However, the Budyko framework is limited to steadystate conditions, being a result of assuming negligible storage change in the land--water balance. Processes leading to changes in the terrestrial water storage at any spatial and/or temporal scale are hence not represented. Here we propose an analytically derived modification of the Budyko framework including a new parameter explicitly representing additional water available to evapotranspiration besides instantaneous precipitation. The modified framework is comprehensively analyzed, showing that the additional parameter leads to a rotation of the original water supply limit. We further evaluate the new formulation in an example application at mean seasonal timescales, showing that the extended framework is able to represent conditions in which monthly to annual evapotranspiration exceeds monthly to annual precipitation.},

  abstract = {Global hydrological models (GHMs) have become an established tool to simulate water resources worldwide. Most of the GHMs are however uncalibrated and typically use a set of basic hydrological parameters, that could potentially lead to unrealistic projections of the terrestrial water cycle. The calibration of hydrological models is usually performed by using and comparing modeled to observed discharge. Accurate station data and reliable time series data of discharge are, however, often not available for many parts of the world and classic calibration approaches are therefore not feasible. In this paper, we aim to develop a new calibration approach that requires no additional data, is easy to implement, and substantially improves model performance, especially in regions where uncalibrated model performance is rather poor. This is achieved by using the Budyko framework, which provides a conceptual representation of the long-term water and energy balance. We use a state-of-the-art GHM and calibrate the model within nine river catchments of different sizes and characteristics. Since observed river discharge is available for these catchments, we are able to compare the Budyko-based calibration approach to a classic discharge-based calibration scheme and the uncalibrated model version. In all catchments, the Budyko-based calibration approach decreases biases and increases model performance compared to the uncalibrated model version although performance improvements obtained through a classic calibration approach are greater. Nonetheless, a Budyko-based calibration is a valuable, intermediate approach between use of a basic set of a priori hydrological parameters and classical calibration against discharge data.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the University of New Hampshire Water Balance Model, WBM, a process-based gridded global hydrologic model that simulates the land surface components of the global water cycle and includes water extraction for use in agriculture and domestic sectors. The WBM was first published in 1989; here, we describe the first fully open-source WBM version (v.1.0.0). Earlier descriptions of WBM methods provide the foundation for the most recent model version that is detailed here. We present an overview of the model functionality, utility, and evaluation of simulated global river discharge and irrigation water use. This new version adds a novel suite of water source tracking modules that enable the analysis of flow-path histories on water supply. A key feature of WBM v.1.0.0 is the ability to identify the partitioning of sources for each stock or flux within the model. Three different categories of tracking are available: (1) primary inputs of water to the surface of the terrestrial hydrologic cycle (liquid precipitation, snowmelt, glacier melt, and unsustainable groundwater); (2) water that has been extracted for human use and returned to the terrestrial hydrologic system; and (3) runoff originating from userdefined spatial land units. Such component tracking provides a more fully transparent model in that users can identify the underlying mechanisms generating the simulated behavior. We find that WBM v.1.0.0 simulates global river discharge and irrigation water withdrawals well, even with default parameter settings, and for the first time, we are able to show how the simulation arrives at these fluxes by using the novel tracking functions.},

In this study, the long-term data series of water surface evaporation (E-p) were assimilated across China, with the observations from 552 national benchmark weather stations. The trends of E-p and the influential climate variables were well detected. The analytical derivation method was built up to quantitatively attribute the effects from 5 key climate fields to E-p variations, including wind speed (u(2)), sunshine duration (n), relative humidity (RH), daily maximum (T-max), and minimum (T-min) air temperature. New hydrological insights for the region: The attribution results were more accurate and reasonable than those from two commonly used statistically based climate elasticity methods, which tended to overestimated the E-p variations. Most weather stations had experienced the decreasing trends of E-p during the entire research period of 1961-2018, which were mainly attributed to the decreasing in u(2), n and RH, while the effects of regional warming (rising air temperature) were less influential on E-p variations at the long-term scale. The variations of E-p attributed to the three main influential climate variables (u(2), n and RH) across China had also shown different temporal and spatial tendency patterns during different historical research periods. For example, the changing n and RH had shown increasing power on E-p variations in the western China climate zones. Comparatively, the u(2) has been losing its power in decreasing E-p in most regions of China due to the slowdown in the declining rates of wind speed. This dynamic E-p attribution process is worthy of continuous focus and systematic research.},

  abstract = {Conducting water resource assessment and forecasting at a basin scale requires effective and accurate simulation of the hydrological process. However, intensive, complex human activities and environmental changes are constraining and challenging the hydrological modeling development and application by complicating the hydrological cycle within its local contexts. Six sub-catchments of the Yellow River basin, the second-largest river in China, situated in a semi-arid climate zone, have been selected for this study, considering hydrological processes under a natural period (before 1970) and under intensive human disturbance (2000--2013). The study aims to assess the capacity and performance of the hydrological models in simulating the discharge under a changing environment. Four well-documented and applied hydrological models, i.e., the Xin'anjiang (XAJ) model, GR4J model, SIMHYD model, and RCCC-WBM (Water Balance Model developed by Research Center for Climate Change) model, were selected for this assessment. The results show that (1) the annual areal temperature of all sub-catchments presented a significant rising trend, and annual precipitation exhibited insignificant decline trend; (2) as a result of climate change and intensive human activities, the annual runoff series showed a declining trend with abrupt changes mostly occurring in the 1980s with the exception of the Tangnaihai station; (3) the four hydrological models generally performed well for runoff simulation for all sub-catchments under the natural period. In terms of Nash--Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, the XAJ model worked better in comparison to other hydrological models due to its detailed representations and complicated mechanism in runoff generation and flow-routing scheme; (4) environmental changes have impacted the performance of the four hydrological models under all sub-catchments, in particularly the Pianguan River catchment, which is could be attributed to the various human activities that in turn represent more complexity for the regional hydrological cycle to some extent, and reduce the ability to predict the runoff series; (5) the RCCC-WBM model, well known for its simple structure and principles, is considered to be acceptable for runoff simulation for both natural and human disturbance periods, and is recommended for water resource assessment under changing environments for semi-arid regions.},

The relative membership degree (u), as the comprehensive evaluation index in the hydrological evaluation, was calculated by the optimum fuzzy model. The results showed that the spatial pattern of precipitation from the CMA dataset and the other 6 precipitation products were very consistent with each other. The satellite-derived rainfall products (SDFE), like PSERSIANN-CDR and TMPA, depicted considerably finer and more detailed spatial heterogeneity. The SDFE and reanalysis (RA) products could estimate the monthly precipitation very well at both gauge and basin-average scales. The runoff simulation results indicated that the APHRODITE and TMPA were superior to the other 4 precipitation datasets, obtaining much higher scores, with average u values of 0.88 and 0.77. The precipitation estimation products tended to show better performance in streamflow simulation at the downstream hydrometric stations. In terms of performance of hydrological models, the RCCC--WBM model showed the best potential for monthly streamflow simulation, followed by the DWBM. It indicated that the monthly models were more flexible than daily conceptual or distributed models in hydrological evaluation of SDFE or RA products, and that the difference in precipitation estimates from various precipitation datasets were more influential in the GR4J and VIC models.},

  abstract = {Understanding the historical and future changing characteristics of key climatic variables and runoff in 10 major river zones in China is essential for water resources evaluation and management. To this end, the historical and future changing trends of key hydrometeorological variables, including precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and runoff were analyzed in detail for each water zone across China. The climate elasticity method was also established to quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on historical runoff variations. The results indicate that the characteristics and causes of runoff variations in China were generally spatially heterogeneous. The runoff in water-scarce river basins of northern China decreased significantly during the period of 1961-2018, variations of which were more sensitive to human activities. For southern water zones in China, the runoff showed no significant trend and climate change was the main influencing factor. On basis of 9 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) climate model ensemble simulations under three different shared socioeconomic pathways (ssp126, ssp245 and ssp585), the future runoff in 10 typical basins of the water zones were projected and the results suggested an increasing trend of runoff over China, thanks to increasing precipitation in the rest 21 century. While under ssp585, the rising air temperature tends to evaporate more water and offset the effect of precipitation increase to some extent, resulting in that the increments of runoff under ssp585 are not necessarily greater than those under ssp245 and ssp126. Overall, our study could be used as a basis to support climate adaptation strategies and policies to cope with future water resources conditions. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Changes in the magnitude, frequency and timing of heavy precipitation are closely related to the occurrence of floods and droughts, which hold a great deal of significance for management of agricultural irrigation and water resources. Records of daily precipitation and temperature from 728 stations across China were used to assess changes in the magnitude, frequency and timing of heavy precipitation using the Peak-over-Threshold (POT) with 95th percentile as the threshold. Because of the continuous nature of the magnitude and timing of heavy precipitation, the "change point" method and the modified Mann-Kendall trend test method were used to detect change points (CPs) and slowly-varying changes, respectively. In addition, the segmented regression and Poisson regression methods were used to detect CPs and temporal trends in the frequency of heavy precipitation, respectively, with consideration of the count nature of the data. The results showed that 55\% and 36\% of the stations had CPs in mean and/or variance of the magnitude and timing, respectively, while the percentage is only 5.8\% in the frequency. However, while there is limited evidence of significant trends in the magnitude and timing, strong evidence points to a significant increasing frequency in most regions of China. These changes may be partly explained by changes in summer temperature. Examination of the summer surface temperature records suggests that the areas, where the frequency of heavy precipitation has a significant increase, are also mostly characterized by significant increasing temperature. In addition, trends of the frequency vary between the periods before and after the turn point (TP) of summer temperature trends, especially in northern China where both the summer temperature and the frequency have shifted significantly decreasing trends to significantly increasing trends. A possible interpretation of these findings is that storms tend to be more frequent without significant changes in water vapor content. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Large-scale hydrological models describing the terrestrial water balance at continental and global scales are increasingly being used in earth system modeling and climate impact assessments. However, because of incomplete process understanding and limits of the forcing data, model simulations remain uncertain. To quantify this uncertainty a multimodel ensemble of nine large-scale hydrological models was compared to observed runoff from 426 small catchments in Europe. The ensemble was built within the framework of the European Union Water and Global Change (WATCH) project. The models were driven with the same atmospheric forcing data. Models were evaluated with respect to their ability to capture the interannual variability of spatially aggregated annual time series of five runoff percentiles-derived from daily time series-including annual low and high flows. Overall, the models capture the interannual variability of low, mean, and high flows well. However, errors in the mean and standard deviation, as well as differences in performance between the models, became increasingly pronounced for low runoff percentiles, reflecting the uncertainty associated with the representation of hydrological processes, such as the depletion of soil moisture stores. The large spread in model performance implies that any single model should be applied with caution as there is a great risk of biased conclusions. However, this large spread is contrasted by the good overall performance of the ensemble mean. It is concluded that the ensemble mean is a pragmatic and reliable estimator of spatially aggregated time series of annual low, mean, and high flows across Europe.},

Gudmundsson               et al.               analyzed thousands of time series of river flows and hydrological extremes across the globe and compared them with model simulations of the terrestrial water cycle (see the Perspective by Hall and Perdig{\~a}o).

Their analysis shows that human influence on climate has affected the magnitude of low, mean, and high river flows on a global scale.

Here, we analyze time series of low, mean, and high river flows from 7250 observatories around the world covering the years 1971 to 2010. We identify spatially complex trend patterns, where some regions are drying and others are wetting consistently across low, mean, and high flows. Trends computed from state-of-the-art model simulations are consistent with the observations only if radiative forcing that accounts for anthropogenic climate change is considered. Simulated effects of water and land management do not suffice to reproduce the observed trend pattern. Thus, the analysis provides clear evidence for the role of externally forced climate change as a causal driver of recent trends in mean and extreme river flow at the global scale.},

While Part 1 (Do et al., 2018a) describes the data collection process as well as the generation of auxiliary catchment data (e.g. catchment boundary, land cover, mean climate), Part 2 introduces a set of quality controlled time-series indices representing (i) the water balance, (ii) the seasonal cycle, (iii) low flows and (iv) floods. To this end we first consider the quality of individual daily records using a combination of quality flags from data providers and automated screening methods. Subsequently, streamflow time-series indices are computed for yearly, seasonal and monthly resolution. The paper provides a generalized assessment of the homogeneity of all generated streamflow time-series indices, which can be used to select time series that are suitable for a specific task. The newly generated global set of streamflow time-series indices is made freely available with an digital object identifier at https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.887470 and is expected to foster global freshwater research, by acting as a ground truth for model validation or as a basis for assessing the role of human impacts on the terrestrial water cycle. It is hoped that a renewed interest in streamflow data at the global scale will foster efforts in the systematic assessment of data quality and provide momentum to overcome administrative barriers that lead to inconsistencies in global collections of relevant hydrological observations.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial water variables are the key to understanding ecosystem processes, feed back on weather and climate, and are a prerequisite for human activities. To provide context for local investigations and to better understand phenomena that only emerge at large spatial scales, reliable information on continental-scale freshwater dynamics is necessary. To date streamflow is among the best-observed variables of terrestrial water systems. However, observation networks have a limited station density and often incomplete temporal coverage, limiting investigations to locations and times with observations. This paper presents a methodology to estimate continental-scale runoff on a 0.5 degrees spatial grid with monthly resolution. The methodology is based on statistical upscaling of observed streamflow from small catchments in Europe and exploits readily available gridded atmospheric forcing data combined with the capability of machine learning techniques. The resulting runoff estimates are validated against (1) runoff from small catchments that were not used for model training, (2) river discharge from nine continental-scale river basins and (3) independent estimates of long-term mean evapotranspiration at the pan-European scale. In addition it is shown that the produced gridded runoff compares on average better to observations than a multi-model ensemble of comprehensive land surface models (LSMs), making it an ideal candidate for model evaluation and model development. In particular, the presented machine learning approach may help determining which factors are most relevant for an efficient modelling of runoff at regional scales. Finally, the resulting data product is used to derive a comprehensive runoff climatology for Europe and its potential for drought monitoring is illustrated.},

Despite its scientific and societal importance, there are to date no pan-European observation-based runoff estimates available. Here we employ a recently developed methodology to estimate monthly runoff rates on regular spatial grid in Europe. For this we first assemble an unprecedented collection of river flow observations, combining information from three distinct databases. Observed monthly runoff rates are subsequently tested for homogeneity and then related to gridded atmospheric variables (E-OBS version 12) using machine learning. The resulting statistical model is then used to estimate monthly runoff rates (December 1950-December 2015) on a 0.5 degrees Chi 0.5 degrees grid. The performance of the newly derived runoff estimates is assessed in terms of cross validation. The paper closes with example applications, illustrating the potential of the new runoff estimates for climatological assessments and drought monitoring.

The assessment is based on the Global Streamflow Indices and Metadata archive and focuses on time series of the annual minimum, the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles, the annual mean, and the annual maximum of daily streamflow. Trends are estimated using the Sen-Theil slope, and the significance of mean regional trends is established through bootstrapping. Changes in the indices are often regionally consistent, showing that the entire flow distribution is moving either upward or downward. In addition, the analysis confirms the complex nature of hydrological change where drying in some regions (e.g., in the Mediterranean) is contrasted by wetting in other regions (e.g., North Asia). Observed changes are discussed in the context of previous results and with respect to model estimates of the impacts of anthropogenic climate change and human water management. Plain Language Summary Studies of trends in streamflow data from across the globe are essential for understanding patterns and changes in water availability (e.g., regions of deficit and abundance) and evaluating the fidelity of global water availability models. This study evaluates historical trends in streamflow data, using a new data set of observations from over 30,000 sites around the world. The study is comprehensive, looking at changes in low flows (defined as the lowest day of flow in each year), average flows, and high flows (the highest day of flow in each year). An interesting outcome is that where trends are present in a region, the direction of the trend is often consistent across all indices for that region (consistently drier or wetter), as distinct from the possibility of stronger extremes (wetter maximums and drier minimums).},

Here we present an approach that allows to estimate the probability that changes in the aridity index have a larger effect on water availability than equal relative changes in other factors. The analysis builds upon a probabilistic extension of the Budyko framework, which is subject to an analytical sensitivity assessment. The results show that changes in water availability are only dominated by changes in the aridity index in very humid climates. This implies that projected intensifications of aridity in drylands may have less influence on water availability than commonly assumed. Instead, other climatic or nonclimatic factors are dominating. The analysis does hence allow to map regions in which water availability is more sensitive to equal relative changes in either the aridity index or all other factors.},

  abstract = {Increasing atmospheric moisture content is expected to intensify precipitation extremes under climate warming. However, extreme precipitation sensitivity (EPS) to temperature is complicated by the presence of reduced or hook-shaped scaling, and the underlying physical mechanisms remain unclear. Here, by using atmospheric reanalysis and climate model projections, we propose a physical decomposition of EPS into thermodynamic and dynamic components (i.e., the effects of atmospheric moisture and vertical ascent velocity) at a global scale in both historical and future climates. Unlike previous expectations, we find that thermodynamics do not always contribute to precipitation intensification, with the lapse rate effect and the pressure component partly offsetting positive EPS. Large anomalies in future EPS projections (with lower and upper quartiles of -1.9\%/{$^\circ$}C and 8.0\%/{$^\circ$}C) are caused by changes in updraft strength (i.e., the dynamic component), with a contrast of positive anomalies over oceans and negative anomalies over land areas. These findings reveal counteracting effects of atmospheric thermodynamics and dynamics on EPS, and underscore the importance of understanding precipitation extremes by decomposing thermodynamic effects into more detailed terms.},

The CMIP models are ranked by comprehensive rating index (MR), which is determined by PBIAS, CC, and RMSE three metrics. Linear Optimal Runoff Aggregate (LORA), Global Runoff Reconstruction (GRUN), and ERA5-Land were selected as reference datasets. LORA was used as the main reference data to evaluate the historical runoff results of CMIP from 1981 to 2012 for three aspects: trend, PBIAS, and uncertainty. Results reveal that (i) CMIP6 models have obviously overvalued on the global and basins (except Amazon and Lena basin); this phenomenon was more prominent in arid and semi-arid areas (Murray-Darling and Nile basin). (ii) Compared with CMIP5 models, CMIP6 models have less uncertainty on the global scale, but it has not made outstanding progress on the basin scale. (iii) CMIP6 multi-model ensemble mean (CMIP6\_MMEs) has better simulation effect than most individual models, which reduces the uncertainty among different models to some extent. (iv) There were differences in trends and PBIAS between the three reference datasets at both the global and basin scale. However, the interannual fluctuations of the three datasets were basically the same and have high correlation coefficient (except for ERA5 in the world and Nile basin), which shows that LORA dataset has high reliability. The global comprehensive rating metric (GR) of CMIP6\_MMEs was better than CMIP5\_MMEs in all metrics, but this result was not found in eight basins. This shows that CMIP6 models has better effect in simulating global runoff and related diagnostic indicators. Implying further improvements are needs for the runoff simulation capability at the basin scale.},

  abstract = {Bias correction techniques are widely used to bridge the gap between climate model outputs and input requirements of hydrological models to assess the climate change impacts on hydrology. In addition to univariate bias correction methods, several multivariate bias correction methods were proposed recently, which can not only correct the biases in marginal distributions of individual climate variables but also properly adjust the biased intervariable correlations simulated by climate models. Due to the diversities of climate regime and climate model bias, hydrological simulation for watersheds under different climate conditions may show various sensitivities to the correction of intervariable correlations. Therefore, it is of great importance to investigate (1) whether the correction of intervariable correlations has impacts on the hydrological modeling and (2) how these impacts vary with watersheds under different climate conditions. To achieve these goals, this study evaluates behaviors and their spatial variability of multiple state-of-the-art multivariate bias correction methods in hydrological modeling over 2,840 watersheds distributed in different climate regimes in North America. The results show that, compared to using a quantile mapping univariate bias correction method, applying multivariate methods can improve the simulation of snow proportion, snowmelt, evaporation, and several streamflow variables. In addition, this improvement is more clear for watersheds with arid and warm temperate climates in southern regions, while it is limited for northern snow-characterized watersheds. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of using multivariate bias correction methods instead of univariate methods in hydrological climate change impact studies, especially for watersheds with arid and warm temperate climates.},

  abstract = {Climatic change has great implications for hydrological cycle and water resources planning. In order to assess this impact. a macro-scale and semi-distributed monthly water balance model was proposed and developed to simulate and predict the hydrological processes. GIS techniques were used as a tool to analyze topography, river networks, land-use. human activities, vegetation and soil characteristics. The model parameters were linked to these basin characteristics by regression and optimization methods. A parameterization scheme was developed and the model parameters were estimated for each grid element. Based on the different GCM and RCM outputs, the sensitivities of hydrology and water resources for China to global warming were studied. The proposed models are capable of producing both the magnitude and timing of runoff and water resources conditions. The semi-dry regions, such as Liaohe, Haihe, Ruanhe and Huaihe River basins in north China, The runoffs of these basins are small or even zero during dry season (from Oct. to May) and are very sensitive to temperature increase and rainfall decrease. While in the basins of the humid south China like Yangtze River basin, the runoffs are perennial and the base flow normally occupies a large portion of the total runoff volume. These humid basins are less vulnerable to climate chance. Results of the study also indicated that runoff is more sensitive to variation in precipitation than to increase in temperature, Climate change challenges existing water resources management practices by additional uncertainty. Integrated water resources management will enhance the potential for adaptation to change. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Here, we present a diagnostically interesting decomposition of NSE (and hence MSE), which facilitates analysis of the relative importance of its different components in the context of hydrological modelling, and show how model calibration problems can arise due to interactions among these components. The analysis is illustrated by calibrating a simple conceptual precipitation-runoff model to daily data for a number of Austrian basins having a broad range of hydro-meteorological characteristics. Evaluation of the results clearly demonstrates the problems that can be associated with any calibration based on the NSE (or MSE) criterion. While we propose and test an alternative criterion that can help to reduce model calibration problems, the primary purpose of this study is not to present an improved measure of model performance. Instead, we seek to show that there are systematic problems inherent with any optimization based on formulations related to the MSE. The analysis and results have implications to the manner in which we calibrate and evaluate environmental models; we discuss these and suggest possible ways forward that may move us towards an improved and diagnostically meaningful approach to model performance evaluation and identification.},

In this opinion paper, we discuss the need to actively promote and pursue the use of a "large catchment sample" approach to modeling the rainfall--runoff process, thereby balancing depth with breadth. We examine the history of such investigations, discuss the benefits (improved process understanding resulting in robustness of prediction at ungauged locations and under change), examine some practical challenges to implementation and, finally, provide perspectives on issues that need to be taken into account as we move forward. Ultimately, our objective is to provoke further discussion and participation, and to promote a potentially important theme for the upcoming Scientific Decade of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences entitled Panta Rhei.},

  abstract = {This study examines global precipitation changes/variations during 1901--2010 by using the long-record GPCC land precipitation analysis, the NOAA/Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites (CICS) reconstructed (RECONS) precipitation analysis, and the CMIP5 outputs. In particular, spatial features of long-term precipitation changes and trends and decadal/interdecadal precipitation variations are explored by focusing on the effects of various physical mechanisms such as the anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) and aerosol forcings and certain internal oscillations including the Pacific decadal variability (PDV) and Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO). Precipitation increases in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) mid- to high-latitude lands observed in GPCC can also be found in RECONS and model simulations. Over tropical/subtropical land areas, precipitation reductions generally appear in all products, but with large discrepancies on regional scales. Over ocean, consistent spatial structures of precipitation change also exist between RECONS and models. It is further found that these long-term changes/trends might be due to both anthropogenic GHG and aerosols. The aerosol effect estimated from CMIP5 historical simulations is then removed from the GPCC, RECONS, and AMIP simulations. These isolated GHG-related changes/trends have many similar spatial features when compared to the CMIP5 GHG-only simulations, especially in the zonal-mean context. Both PDV and AMO have influence on spatial patterns of precipitation variations during the past century. In the NH middle to high latitudes, PDV and AMO have played an important role on interdecadal/multidecadal time scales. In several tropical/subtropical regions, their impacts may even become dominant for certain time spans including the recent past two decades. Therefore, these two internal mechanisms make the estimations of GHG and aerosol effects on precipitation on decadal/interdecadal time scales very challenging, especially on regional scales.},

Climate change is expected to additionally affect water supply and demand. Here, analyses of climate change and direct human impacts on the terrestrial water cycle are presented and compared using a multimodel approach. Seven global hydrological models have been forced with multiple climate projections, and with and without taking into account impacts of human interventions such as dams and water withdrawals on the hydrological cycle. Model results are analyzed for different levels of global warming, allowing for analyses in line with temperature targets for climate change mitigation. The results indicate that direct human impacts on the water cycle in some regions, e. g., parts of Asia and in the western United States, are of the same order of magnitude, or even exceed impacts to be expected for moderate levels of global warming (+2 K). Despite some spread in model projections, irrigation water consumption is generally projected to increase with higher global mean temperatures. Irrigation water scarcity is particularly large in parts of southern and eastern Asia, and is expected to become even larger in the future.},

  abstract = {The representation of hydrological land surface processes has, so far, been treated inadequately in global models of the atmospheric general circulation (GCMs). In particular the lateral waterflows from the continents into the ocean have been described unsatisfactorily. The aim of this study is to develop a model for the lateral waterflow on the global scale which describes the translation and retention of the lateral discharge as a function of the spatially distributed land surface characteristics that are globally available. Here, global scale refers to the resolution of 0.5 degrees and smaller, corresponding to a typical GCM gridbox area of about 2500 km(2). Discharge models need a number of specific input variables that are usually not available from measurements such as runoff and drainage. Therefore, these variables have to be derived from observed data such as precipitation and surface air temperature. For the model development in this study, a new simplified land surface scheme was applied to compute these variables. The discharge from a catchment of approximately the size of a 0.5 degrees gridbox was simulated using several types of models. The intercomparison of the simulated lateral flows of the different models shows that as a minimum a separation between flow processes such as overland flow, baseflow and riverflow is required to yield good discharge simulations. As both the retention and translation of a flow process need to be simulated, a two-parameter model is required for the representation of overland flow and riverflow. For the baseflow, a one-parameter model is sufficient. The resulting model structure is called the hydrological discharge model or HD model. A first parametrization approach was defined using the gridbox characteristics of topography gradient and gridbox length. The skill of the discharge simulation depends not only on the formulations of the model, but also on the precise definition of the boundaries of the model catchments. The sizes and the positioning of the model catchments on the globe were defined by using a river direction file as well as a modified topography dataset. In a first application, the HD model successfully simulated river discharge using runoff and drainage from a five year atmospheric GCM integration (ECHAM4-T42) as input. The annual cycles of the monthly means of the simulated discharge of several large rivers were compared to the observed discharges provided by the Global Runoff Data Centre. The HD model achieves a considerable improvement of the simulated discharge compared to the model which is currently operational at MPI. The improved volume of the discharge is directly related to the definition of more realistic model catchments and the improved timing of the flow is mainly due to the newly introduced separation of the flow processes.},

While simple models with low data and expertise requirements are attractive, their use as decision-aid tools should be supported by uncertainty characterization. We assessed the performance of the InVEST annual water yield model, a popular tool for ecosystem service assessment based on the Budyko hydrological framework. Our study involved the comparison of 10 subcatchments ranging in size and land-use configuration, in the Cape Fear basin, North Carolina. We analyzed the model sensitivity to climate variables and input parameters, and the structural error associated with the use of the Budyko framework, a lumped (catchment-scale) model theory, in a spatially explicit way. Comparison of model predictions with observations and with the lumped model predictions confirmed that the InVEST model is able to represent differences in land uses and therefore in the spatial distribution of water provisioning services. Our results emphasize the effect of climate input errors, especially annual precipitation, and errors in the ecohydrological parameter Z, which are both comparable to the model structure uncertainties. Our case study supports the use of the model for predicting land-use change effect on water provisioning, although its use for identifying areas of high water yield will be influenced by precipitation errors. While some results are context-specific, our study provides general insights and methods to help identify the regions and decision contexts where the model predictions may be used with confidence.},

  abstract = {Humans abstract water from various sources to sustain their livelihood and society. Some global hydrological models (GHMs) include explicit schemes of human water abstraction, but the representation and performance of these schemes remain limited. We substantially enhanced the water abstraction schemes of the H08 GHM. This enabled us to estimate water abstraction from six major water sources, namely, river flow regulated by global reservoirs (i.e., reservoirs regulating the flow of the world's major rivers), aqueduct water transfer, local reservoirs, seawater desalination, renewable groundwater, and nonrenewable groundwater. In its standard setup, the model covers the whole globe at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees, and the calculation interval is 1 day. All the interactions were simulated in a single computer program, and all water fluxes and storage were strictly traceable at any place and time during the simulation period. A global hydrological simulation was conducted to validate the performance of the model for the period of 1979-2013 (land use was fixed for the year 2000). The simulated water fluxes for water abstraction were validated against those reported in earlier publications and showed a reasonable agreement at the global and country level. The simulated monthly river discharge and terrestrial water storage (TWS) for six of the world's most significantly human-affected river basins were compared with gauge observations and the data derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. It is found that the simulation including the newly added schemes outperformed the simulation without human activities. The simulated results indicated that, in 2000, of the 3628 +/- 75 km(3) yr(-1) global freshwater requirement, 2839 +/- 50 km(3) yr(-1) was taken from surface water and 789 +/- 30 km(3) yr(-1) from groundwater. Streamflow, aqueduct water transfer, local reservoirs, and seawater desalination accounted for 1786 +/- 23, 199 +/- 10, 106 +/- 5, and 1.8 +/- 0 km(3) yr(-1) of the surface water, respectively. The remaining 747 +/- 45 km(3) yr(-1) freshwater requirement was unmet, or surface water was not available when and where it was needed in our simulation. Renewable and nonrenewable groundwater accounted for 607 +/- 11 and 182 +/- 26 km(3) yr(-1) of the groundwater total, respectively. Each source differed in its renewability, economic costs for development, and environmental consequences of usage. The model is useful for performing global water resource assessments by considering the aspects of sustainability, economy, and environment.},

  abstract = {To assess global water availability and use at a subannual timescale, an integrated global water resources model was developed consisting of six modules: land surface hydrology, river routing, crop growth, reservoir operation, environmental flow requirement estimation, and anthropogenic water withdrawal. The model simulates both natural and anthropogenic water flow globally (excluding Antarctica) on a daily basis at a spatial resolution of 1\&deg;\&times;1\&deg; (longitude and latitude). This first part of the two-feature report describes the six modules and the input meteorological forcing. The input meteorological forcing was provided by the second Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP2), an international land surface modeling project. Several reported shortcomings of the forcing component were improved. The land surface hydrology module was developed based on a bucket type model that simulates energy and water balance on land surfaces. The crop growth module is a relatively simple model based on concepts of heat unit theory, potential biomass, and a harvest index. In the reservoir operation module, 452 major reservoirs with \&gt;1 km3 each of storage capacity store and release water according to their own rules of operation. Operating rules were determined for each reservoir by an algorithm that used currently available global data such as reservoir storage capacity, intended purposes, simulated inflow, and water demand in the lower reaches. The environmental flow requirement module was newly developed based on case studies from around the world. Simulated runoff was compared and validated with observation-based global runoff data sets and observed streamflow records at 32 major river gauging stations around the world. Mean annual runoff agreed well with earlier studies at global and continental scales, and in individual basins, the mean bias was less than \&plusmn;20\% in 14 of the 32 river basins and less than \&plusmn;50\% in 24 basins. The error in the peak was less than \&plusmn;1 mo in 19 of the 27 basins and less than \&plusmn;2 mo in 25 basins. The performance was similar to the best available precedent studies with closure of energy and water. The input meteorological forcing component and the integrated model provide a framework with which to assess global water resources, with the potential application to investigate the subannual variability in water resources.},

  abstract = {To assess global water resources from the perspective of subannual variation in water availability and water use, an integrated water resources model was developed. In a companion report, we presented the global meteorological forcing input used to drive the model and six modules, namely, the land surface hydrology module, the river routing module, the crop growth module, the reservoir operation module, the environmental flow requirement module, and the anthropogenic withdrawal module. Here, we present the results of the model application and global water resources assessments. First, the timing and volume of simulated agriculture water use were examined because agricultural use composes approximately 85\% of total consumptive water withdrawal in the world. The estimated crop calendar showed good agreement with earlier reports for wheat, maize, and rice in major countries of production. In major countries, the error in the planting date was \&plusmn;1 mo, but there were some exceptional cases. The estimated irrigation water withdrawal also showed fair agreement with country statistics, but tended to be underestimated in countries in the Asian monsoon region. The results indicate the validity of the model and the input meteorological forcing because site-specific parameter tuning was not used in the series of simulations. Finally, global water resources were assessed on a subannual basis using a newly devised index. This index located water-stressed regions that were undetected in earlier studies. These regions, which are indicated by a gap in the subannual distribution of water availability and water use, include the Sahel, the Asian monsoon region, and southern Africa. The simulation results show that the reservoir operations of major reservoirs (\&gt;1 km3) and the allocation of environmental flow requirements can alter the population under high water stress by approximately \&minus;11\% to +5\% globally. The integrated model is applicable to assessments of various global environmental projections such as climate change.},

The recognition of key factors plays a vital role and thus affects the performance of the model. However, there is no conclusion on which recognition algorithm is the most suitable. To address this issue, an LSTM model combined with two attention mechanisms both in the input and hidden layers, namely AT-LSTM, is proposed for long-term runoff forecasting at Yichang and Pingshan stations in China. The added attention mechanisms automatically assign weights to 130 climate phenomenon indexes, avoiding the use of subjectively set recognition algorithms. Results show that the AT-LSTM model outperforms the Pearson's correlation based LSTM model in terms of four evaluation metrics for monthly runoff forecasting. Further, the set indirect runoff prediction method verifies that the AT-LSTM model also performs effectively in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration forecasting, and the indirect runoff prediction is inferior to the AT-LSTM model to establish a direct link between climate factors and runoff. Finally, four key factors related to runoff are identified by the attention mechanism and their impacts on runoff are analyzed on intra- and inter-annual scales. The proposed AT-LSTM model can effectively improve the accuracy of long-term forecasting and identify the dynamic influence of input factors.},

In addition, the potential4 mechanisms are examined by applying the atmospheric moisture budget decomposition method to the outputs from the ERA-Interim medium-range weather forecasting reanalysis produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Changes in global monsoon precipitation are primarily thermodynamically caused by changes in specific humidity and dynamically caused by changes in circulation, as well as by changes in moisture transport that are driven by transient eddies and local evaporation. The results show that the increasing trends in global summer monsoon precipitation from 1979 to 2016 were dominated by contributions from the southern Asian, South African, and North American monsoon regions and were driven by the response of atmospheric circulation to the enhanced east--west thermal contrast in the tropical Pacific. We find that changes in the sea surface temperature (SST) patterns promote increased low-level vertical velocities in monsoon regions, leading to moisture convergence through divergent circulation anomalies when combined with the climatological humidity field. Hence, the processes result in increasing trends in monsoon precipitation. In addition, evaporation makes increasing contributions to monsoon precipitation throughout the world, except in the South American monsoon region. Moreover, subtropical regions in the East Pacific (the Atlantic) may be major sources of water vapour that have supported increases in precipitation over the southern Asian and North American monsoon regions (the South African monsoon region) in recent decades.},

  abstract = {As a crucial source of runoff in headwater regions, seasonal snowmelt plays an important role in ensuring water availability downstream, particularly during low flow periods. As the major constituent of China's water towers, the headwater region of the Yangtze River (HRYR) provides water to hundreds of millions of people downstream. Therefore, accurately simulating snowmelt is critical to developing a better understanding of the hydrological processes, which would, in turn, benefit water supply management, irrigation, hydropower generation, and ecological integrity over the HRYR and its lower reaches. However, it is a considerable challenge to conduct hydrological modeling for ungauged and poorly gauged headwater regions, owing to a lack of in situ measurements to appropriately constrain the model and evaluate its results. Satellite remote sensing provides an unprecedented opportunity to capture hydrological state variables globally, such as snow cover area (SCA) based on optical remote sensing and snow water equivalent (SWE) based on passive microwave remote sensing. This study simulates snow and glacier meltwater of the HRYR (above the Zhimenda gauging station), and quantifies proportional meltwater contributions to total runoff using multisource remote sensing data and a distributed hydrological model. We, for the first time ever, evaluate the snowmelt simulations based on the hydrological consistency among precipitation, air and land surface temperatures, and remotely sensed SWE/SCA. Results show that the snowmelt simulations using either SWE or SCA as a reference for calibrating parameters of the hydrological model are highly consistent, with snow and glacier meltwater contributing similar to 7\% and similar to 5\%, respectively, to the total runoff during 2003-2014. This study serves as a basis to simulate snowmelt to understand runoff generation and evolution under climate change across ungauged and poorly gauged headwater regions using multisource remote sensing data.},

  abstract = {The changes in climate and catchment properties have altered the hydrological processes significantly at different spatiotemporal scales around the world. In particular for finer time scales, changes in water storage, which has been commonly neglected for long-term temporal scales, may play an important role on hydrological processes. Nevertheless, few studies addressed this question in modifying the Budyko framework, with most of them remaining a steady-state assumption on catchment characteristics. Here, we derive new analytical formulas of unsteady-state streamflow elasticity in a modified Budyko framework, incorporating both storage change and one specific parameter for catchment properties. We study 78 humid catchments in the USA with simulation data of daily hydrological processes from a probability-distribution-based hydrological model (the modified HyMOD). As indicated by results, the annual storage change ratio is linearly correlated with the annual aridity index, and this relationship can be used to estimate elasticity coefficients with our formulas. The estimated elasticity coefficients perform well in simulating the annual streamflow with the power-law model. For different catchments, variability of the unsteady-state elasticity is higher than that of the steady-state elasticity. Unsteady-state streamflow coefficients show significant linear correlation with catchment properties, such as the average slope, average elevation, and catchment area. This study provides a new analytical approach to investigate the interannual stability of catchments with varying climate and catchment properties.},

Due to the relationship between precipitation and temperature, both of which are affected by El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in large regions across the globe, joint modeling of their variability under influences of ENSO is desirable for understanding compound events. In this study, a statistical approach is proposed for the evaluation and prediction of compound precipitation and temperature events (with a focus on compound dry and hot events) under influences of ENSO by constructing the joint distribution of precipitation, temperature, and the ENSO indicator. The joint probability of precipitation and temperature is compared with the conditional probability given different states of ENSO for June--July-August (JJA) and December--January-February (DJF) over global land areas. Results show that ENSO affects the risk of compound dry and hot events in regions including southern Canada, northern South America, southeast Asia, south Africa, and part of Australia. The conditional distribution of precipitation and temperature given ENSO enables the probabilistic prediction of compound events. The strong El Ni{\~n}o event during DJF 2015--2016 significantly affects risks of the compound dry and hot event and provides useful early warning information for large regions including northern South America and south Africa. This study provides useful insights for improved understanding and early warning of compound dry and hot events to reduce their negative impacts.},

However, the impact pathway from ENSO to vegetation (i.e., relationship among ENSO, climate anomalies, and vegetation) is still unclear in southern Africa. In this study, we investigated the impact of ENSO on vegetation (represented by the Normalized Dif\- ference Vegetation Index, NDVI) through its impacts on compound dry and hot extremes in austral summers (December-January-February, DJF) from 1982 to 2015 in southern Africa. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Temperature Index (STI) are used as dry and hot indicators, respectively. The response of NDVI to ENSO during DJF is assessed based on correlation analysis and negative correlation coefficients are present for 87.3\% of southern Africa. In addition, the response of NDVI anomaly (NDVIA) to both dry and hot conditions are also investigated, which shows positive NDVIA-SPI correlations and negative NDVIA-STI corre\- lations for 83.2\% and 76.5\% of the area, respectively. The area percentage with significant impacts of ENSO on concurrent dry and hot events is estimated as 45.29\%. Finally, we also evaluated lag effects between vegetation and dry/hot conditions and between dry/hot conditions and ENSO. Vegetation changes from September to December 2015 illustrate the connection among ENSO, compound dry and hot events, and vegetation decline in southern Africa. This study can aid our understanding of ENSO induced climate extremes and their impacts on vegetation in southern Africa.},

While impact assessment and adaptation planning rely on high-resolution projections (typically in the order of a few kilometers), state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs) are available at spatial resolutions of few hundreds of kilometers. Current solutions to obtain high-resolution projections of ESMs include downscaling approaches that consider the information at a coarse-scale to make predictions at local scales. Complex and non-linear interdependence among local climate variables (e.g., temperature and precipitation) and large-scale predictors (e.g., pressure fields) motivate the use of neural network-based super-resolution architectures. In this work, we present auxiliary variables informed spatio-temporal neural architecture for statistical downscaling. The current study performs daily downscaling of precipitation variable from an ESM output at 1.15 degrees (115 km) to 1/4 degrees (25 km) over one of the most climatically diversified countries, India. We showcase significant improvement gain against two popular state-of-the-art baselines with a better ability to predict statistics of extreme events.

We confirm a linear relationship between bias and elevation above 1,500 meters where TMPA underestimates measured precipitation, providing a proof-of-concept of how simple linear scaling can be used to augment existing satellite datasets.

  abstract = {Ideally, the results from models operating at different scales should agree in trend direction and magnitude of impacts under climate change. However, this implies that the sensitivity to climate variability and climate change is comparable for impact models designed for either scale. In this study, we compare hydrological changes simulated by 9 global and 9 regional hydrological models (HM) for 11 large river basins in all continents under reference and scenario conditions. The foci are on model validation runs, sensitivity of annual discharge to climate variability in the reference period, and sensitivity of the long-term average monthly seasonal dynamics to climate change. One major result is that the global models, mostly not calibrated against observations, often show a considerable bias in mean monthly discharge, whereas regional models show a better reproduction of reference conditions. However, the sensitivity of the two HM ensembles to climate variability is in general similar. The simulated climate change impacts in terms of long-term average monthly dynamics evaluated for HM ensemble medians and spreads show that the medians are to a certain extent comparable in some cases, but have distinct differences in other cases, and the spreads related to global models are mostly notably larger. Summarizing, this implies that global HMs are useful tools when looking at large-scale impacts of climate change and variability. Whenever impacts for a specific river basin or region are of interest, e.g. for complex water management applications, the regional-scale models calibrated and validated against observed discharge should be used.},

An important issue for these decision makers, and for organizations that fund climate research, is what is the potential for climate science to deliver improvements-especially reductions in uncertainty-in such predictions? Uncertainty in climate predictions arises from three distinct sources: internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty. Using data from a suite of climate models, we separate and quantify these sources. For predictions of changes in surface air temperature on decadal timescales and regional spatial scales, we show that uncertainty for the next few decades is dominated by sources (model uncertainty and internal variability) that are potentially reducible through progress in climate science. Furthermore, we find that model uncertainty is of greater importance than internal variability. Our findings have implications for managing adaptation to a changing climate. Because the costs of adaptation are very large, and greater uncertainty about future climate is likely to be associated with more expensive adaptation, reducing uncertainty in climate predictions is potentially of enormous economic value. We highlight the need for much more work to compare (a) the cost of various degrees of adaptation, given current levels of uncertainty and (b) the cost of new investments in climate science to reduce current levels of uncertainty. Our study also highlights the importance of targeting climate science investments on the most promising opportunities to reduce prediction uncertainty.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

Understanding the quantitative impacts of projected climate and human factors on future runoff variations is essential for adaptability assessment of water resource management, especially at the seasonal scale where their intra-annual changes are detected. In this study, an extended Budyko framework that combines traditional elasticity and decomposition methods is developed to analyze future seasonal runoff variations. The upper reach of the Hanjiang River basin (UHRB) in China is used as a case study. The case results are quantified and compared with the monthly ABCD model using historical hydrometeorological observations over 1961--2020 and near-future climate projections over 2031--2060 from the multi-model ensemble of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP3b). We find that: (1) human activities including the operation of the Han-to-Wei inter-basin water transfer (IBWT) and reforestation projects have a substantial negative impact on runoff reduction in this region, accounting for a proportion of {$\sim$}70\% in energy-limited seasons and {$\sim$}65\% in water-limited seasons; and (2) the role of climate change projected by ISIMIP3b will intensify in energy-limited seasons, especially under the high-emission scenario with the increasing trend of effective precipitation,. Additionally, the performance of our extended Budyko framework is sufficiently robust to parameter disturbance experiments, indicating its applicability as an alternative for exploring future seasonal runoff variations.},

A surprising finding is that a robust decrease in extratropical sensible heat transport is found only in the equilibrium climate response, as estimated in slab ocean responses to the doubling of CO2, and not in transient climate change scenarios. All of these robust responses are consequences of the increase in lower-tropospheric water vapor.},

  abstract = {The level of model complexity that can be effectively supported by available information has long been a subject of many studies in hydrologic modelling. In particular, distributed parameter models tend to be regarded as overparameterized because of numerous parameters used to describe spatially heterogeneous hydrologic processes. However, it is not clear how parameters and observations influence the degree of overparameterization, equifinality of parameter values, and uncertainty. This study investigated the impact of the numbers of observations and parameters on calibration quality including equifinality among calibrated parameter values, model performance, and output/parameter uncertainty using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model. In the experiments, the number of observations was increased by expanding the calibration period or by including measurements made at inner points of a watershed. Similarly, additional calibration parameters were included in the order of their sensitivity. Then, unique sets of parameters were calibrated with the same objective function, optimization algorithm, and stopping criteria but different numbers of observations. The calibration quality was quantified with statistics calculated based on the `behavioural' parameter sets, identified using 1\% and 5\% cutoff thresholds in a generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation framework. The study demonstrated that equifinality, model performance, and output/parameter uncertainty were responsive to the numbers of observations and calibration parameters; however, the relationship between the numbers, equifinality, and uncertainty was not always conclusive. Model performance improved with increased numbers of calibration parameters and observations, and substantial equifinality did neither necessarily mean bad model performance nor large uncertainty in the model outputs and parameters.

ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

  abstract = {The two-dimensional steady-state Budyko framework, widely used to study water-energy dynamics in landscapes, primarily focused on the partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration (ET) and water yield. Though this framework has been extended by incorporating water storage changes into precipitation input for non-steady state conditions, the interactions among water-energy dynamics, vegetation covers, and ocean-atmosphere oscillations within the Budyko framework at finer spatial and temporal scales have been unexplored. This study aims to investigate the interactions of regional hydroclimatic conditions, vegetation, and climate teleconnections over the Indo-China Peninsula (ICP), a region highly vulnerable to climate change. To achieve the objective, we propose a three-dimensional Budyko framework that incorporates the ratio of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)-based terrestrial water storage (TWS) or its changes (TWSC) to precipitation (SI/SCI) as the third dimension alongside the traditional two-dimensional Budyko framework. Our findings reveal that TWS has a significant impact on the Budyko framework, particularly during the dry season. The dryness index (DI)/evaporative index (EI) and SI/SCI exhibit positive (strongly negative) linear relationships in the wet (dry) season, respectively. Vegetation covers strongly influence the three-dimensional Budyko framework, with poor performance observed in highly vegetated regions due to high ET demand. Through relative importance analysis, we identify the Silk Road Pattern (SRP) as the most influential climate teleconnection among nine different teleconnections, affecting hydroclimatic conditions over the ICP. Positive (negative) phases of SRP encourage water-limited (energy-limited) ET conditions. This demonstrates that the Budyko parameter is influenced not only by landscapes but also by climate teleconnections, offering potential benefits for Budyko parameter estimation. Furthermore, the linear relationships between DI/EI and SI/SCI in three-dimensional Budyko framework can provide a promising alternative method for evapotranspiration and groundwater estimation.},

  abstract = {The Yellow River is the second largest river in China. The annual runoff of which is only about 2 \% of China's total, but contributes to 9 \% of China's GDP and directly supports 12 \% of the population. Today, the water shortage in the Yellow River basin has been aggravated due to rapid population growth and global warming. In order to best maximize water resources management, the natural and observed streamflow series from six hydrologic gauging stations (Guide, Lanzhou, Hekou, Sanmenxia, Huayuankou, and Lijin) are obtained, and the linear regression, Mann-Kendall test, and wavelet transform methods were used to detect the characteristic of streamflow variation from 1956 to 2007. The results show that: (1) both the natural streamflow and observed streamflow present a downward trend over the past 52 years, and the trends are intensified downstream; the decreasing rate of observed streamflow is more rapid than that of the natural streamflow; (2) most of the abrupt changes in natural streamflow and observed streamflow appear in the late 1980s to early 1990s through the result of the Mann-Kendall test; and (3) other than the Guide station, the streamflows at the rest of the stations appear to have strongest periodicity of 19-21 years with a 52-year scale. The results of this study imply that less precipitation and warmer climate in the basin are the primary factors that cause this decreasing trend of natural streamflow. Additionally, the rapid ascent of water consumption by human being results in the reduction of observed streamflow further. Furthermore, human activities like reservoir construction, soil and water conservation measures, etc. influence the streamflow as well. It is recommended that the society takes some effective countermeasures to cope with the water shortage.},

The regulations of glaciers in hydrological cycles are crucial to the arid regions. We aim to quantify the dynamics of the glaciers' hydrological regulating function in the UMNS and UMZT from 1971 to 2100 using a glacier hydrological regulation index (GlacierR). New hydrological insights for the region: Our results indicate that the glacier runoff in both basins showed a decreasing trend in the past four decades and will continue decreasing in the future under three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs): SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5. The UMZT has a stronger regulating function of glacial runoff than the UMNS. In contrast, the tipping point of the glaciers' hydrological regulating function in the UMNS occurred ten years earlier than in the UMZT. Under the three SSPs, the glaciers' hydrological regulation function on the north -and south-facing slopes of the Tianshan Mountains will show a weakening trend. The weakness trend is more notable in UMZT, where the glaciers' hydrological regulation function will decrease by 66.9 \% between 2061 and 2100 under SSP1-2.6. Thus, it sets alarm bells for the rational use of water resources in glacier-covered arid regions.},

  abstract = {Concern over the potential impact of anthropogenic climate change on flooding has led to a proliferation of studies examining past flood trends. Many studies have analysed annual-maximum flow trends but few have quantified changes in major (25-100 year return period) floods, i.e. those that have the greatest societal impacts. Existing major-flood studies used a limited number of very large catchments affected to varying degrees by alterations such as reservoirs and urbanisation. In the current study, trends in major flood occurrence from 1961 to 2010 and from 1931 to 2010 were assessed using a very large dataset ({$>$}1200 gauges) of diverse catchments from North America and Europe; only minimally altered catchments were used, to focus on climate-driven changes rather than changes due to catchment alterations. Trend testing of major floods was based on counting the number of exceedances of a given flood threshold within a group of gauges. Evidence for significant trends varied between groups of gauges that were defined by catchment size, location, climate, flood threshold and period of record, indicating that generalizations about flood trends across large domains or a diversity of catchment types are ungrounded. Overall, the number of significant trends in major-flood occurrence across North America and Europe was approximately the number expected due to chance alone. Changes over time in the occurrence of major floods were dominated by multidecadal variability rather than by long-term trends. There were more than three times as many significant relationships between major-flood occurrence and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation than significant long-term trends.

  abstract = {Tree restoration is an effective way to store atmospheric carbon and mitigate climate change. However, large-scale tree-cover expansion has long been known to increase evaporation, leading to reduced local water availability and streamflow. More recent studies suggest that increased precipitation, through enhanced atmospheric moisture recycling, can offset this effect. Here we calculate how 900 million hectares of global tree restoration would impact evaporation and precipitation using an ensemble of data-driven Budyko models and the UTrack moisture recycling dataset. We show that the combined effects of directly enhanced evaporation and indirectly enhanced precipitation create complex patterns of shifting water availability. Large-scale tree-cover expansion can increase water availability by up to 6\% in some regions, while decreasing it by up to 38\% in others. There is a divergent impact on large river basins: some rivers could lose 6\% of their streamflow due to enhanced evaporation, while for other rivers, the greater evaporation is counterbalanced by more moisture recycling. Several so-called hot spots for forest restoration could lose water, including regions that are already facing water scarcity today. Tree restoration significantly shifts terrestrial water fluxes, and we emphasize that future tree-restoration strategies should consider these hydrological effects.},

Validation of the model is done against mean annual river basin outflows. The water balance is calculated in two steps: first a "vertical" water balance is calculated that includes evaporation from in situ rainfall ("green" water) and incremental evaporation from irrigated crops. In a second stage, a "horizontal" water balance is calculated to determine discharges from river (sub-) basins, taking into account incremental evaporation from irrigation, open water and wetlands ("blue" water). The paper describes the methodology, input and output data, calibration and validation of the model. The model results are finally compared with other global water balance models to assess levels of accuracy and validity.},

  abstract = {This paper analyses types and rates of change in river meander morphology and the links between mechanisms of change and emergent behaviour of planform morphology. It uses evidence of four dates of aerial photography combined with annual field mapping and ground photography to examine the morphological changes and mechanisms of change in a series of bends on an active meandering river, the River Dane in NW England, over a 25 year period. This unique data set allows insight into the spatial and temporal variability of bank line movement and component processes. Bank lines were mapped photogrametrically from air photos of 1984, 1996, 2001 and 2007 and the digitised courses compared in ArcGIS to produce calculations of erosional and depositional areas and rates. Most bends exhibit morphological change that largely follows the autogenic sequence, identified in qualitative models of meander development, from low sinuosity curves through simple symmetric and asymmetric bends to compound forms with lobe development in the apex region. Rates of erosion and bankline movement increase through this sequence until the compound phase. Relationships of amounts of movement to various curvature measures of bend morphology are complex. Several new loops, distinct from compound bend behaviour, have developed during the study period in formerly straight sections. Mechanisms of morphological change are illustrated for four types of bends: new, rapid growth bend; sharp-angled bend with mid-channel bar development; symmetric migrating bend; and simple to compound bend development. The changes take place in phases that are not simply related to discharge but to inherent sequences and feedbacks in development of bars and bend morphology and timescales for these are identified. Overall, emergent behaviour of systematic planform change, moderated by channel confinement and boundary features, is produced from spatially and temporally varied channel processes.

Here, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of simulated runoff from 21 global models, including 12 climate models from CMIP6, six global hydrological models from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Inter-Comparison Project (ISMIP2a) and three land surface models from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), against observed streamflow in 840 unimpaired catchments globally. Our results show that (a) no model performs consistently better in estimating runoff from all aspects, and all models tend to perform better in more humid regions and non-cold areas; (b) the interannual runoff variability is well represented in ISIMIP2a and GLDAS models, and no model performs satisfactorily in capturing the annual runoff trend; (c) the runoff intra-annual cycle is reasonably captured by all models yet an overestimation of intra-annual variability and an early bias in peak flow timing are commonly found; and (d) model uncertainty leads to a larger uncertainty in runoff estimates than that induced by forcing uncertainty in ISIMIP2a, and model uncertainty in GLDAS is larger than that in ISIMIP2a. Finally, we confirm that the multi-model ensemble is an effective way to reduce uncertainty in individual models except for CMIP6 regarding mean annual magnitude and annual runoff trend. Overall, our findings suggest that assessments/projections of runoff changes based on these global outputs contain great uncertainties and should be interpreted with caution, and call for more advanced, observation-guided ensemble techniques for better large-scale hydrological applications.},

Due to the increasing trends in both the GMA and GMP, a global monsoon intensity (GMI) index, which measures the global monsoon precipitation amount per unit area, is introduced. The GMI measures the strength of the global monsoon. Our calculations with both the GPCP and CMAP datasets show a consistent downward trend in the GMI over the past 30 years. This decreasing trend is primarily attributed to a greater percentage increase in the GMA than in the GMP. A further diagnosis reveals that the decrease of the GMI is primarily attributed to the land monsoon in the GPCP, but to the oceanic monsoon in the CMAP. Citation: Hsu, P.-C., T. Li, and B.

Study focus: The possible future changes in meteorological, hydrological and agricultural drought in Central Asia are analyzed based on the multi-model projections from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The changes in hydroclimate variables and drought events are examined to reveal the responses to different emissions pathway by comparing the historical period (1995???2014) and future period (2081???2100). New hydrological insights for the region: Corresponding to the spatially consistent warming in Central Asia, an asymmetrical west???east-orientated dipole precipitation pattern, i.e., a decrease in the west but an increase in the east, is found in the warm-season (April to September) precipi-tation of future projections. A similar but even stronger west???east or northwest???southeast contrast is found in the changes in total runoff and surface soil moisture in response to future warming. Most of Central Asia shows an increase in drought frequency and duration by the end of the current century, mainly caused by the consistently enhanced evaporation that roughly balances the precipitation growth after 2030. When the effect of temperature is considered, the drought area of Central Asia displays a significant upward trend under both the moderate and high emissions pathway. However, in the east of the region, including Northwest China and western Mongolia, warming and wetting tendencies under the future warming climate are apparent, regardless of the drought definition.},

In addition, the Heihe River Basin has complete landscape, moderate watershed size, and typical social ecological environmental problems. So far, there has been no detailed assessment of glaciers change information of the whole river basin. 1:50,000 topographic map data, Landsat TM/ETM+ remote sensing images and digital elevation model data were used in this research. Through integrated computer automatic interpretation and visual interpretation methods, the object-oriented image feature extraction method was applied to extract glacier outline information. Glaciers change data were derived from analysis, and the glacier variation and its response to climate change in the period 1956/1963-2007/2011 were also analyzed. The results show that: (1) In the period 1956/1963-2007/2011, the Heihe River Basin's glaciers had an evident retreat trend, the total area of glaciers decreased from 361.69 km(2) to 231.17 km(2); shrinking at a rate of 36.08\%, with average single glacier area decrease 0.14 km(2); the total number of the glaciers decreased from 967 to 800. (2) Glaciers in this basin are mainly distributed at elevations of 4300-4400 m, 4400-4500 m and 4500-4600 m; and there are significant regional differences in glaciers distribution and glaciers change. (3) Compared with other western mountain glaciers, glaciers retreat in the Heihe River Basin has a higher rate. (4) Analysis of the six meteorological stations' annual average temperature and precipitation data from 1960 to 2010 suggests that the mean annual temperature increased significantly and the annual precipitation also showed an increasing trend. It is concluded that glacier shrinkage is closely related with temperature rising, besides, glacier melting caused by rising temperatures greater than glacier mass supply by increased precipitation to some extent.},

  abstract = {As China's main grain producing region, the Yangtze River basin is vulnerable to changes in wet and dry conditions. In this study, the monthly scale of standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was calculated, based on the Penman--Monteith equation from 239 meteorological stations in the Yangtze River basin, from 1960 to 2017. Water regime characteristic areas of the Yangtze River basin were extracted and divided using the rotating empirical orthogonal function (REOF). The linear trend of the drought and wetness indicators, the abrupt changes of the rotated principal component time series (RPCs), and the change periods of the drought/wetness intensity (DI/WI) in each subregion were analyzed and discussed. Subsequently, the effects of El Ni{\~n}o-southern oscillation (ENSO) and arctic oscillation (AO) on drought and wetness events were discussed. The results showed that the Yangtze River basin has the characteristic of coexistence of drought and wetness, and drought and wetness of similar severity tend to occur in the same region. There were six subregions extracted through REOF, based on the monthly scale of SPEI, of which the northwestern pattern had an aridization tendency. The stations with significantly increased wetness were located in the middle and eastern basin. The stations in the south of the northwestern pattern, and the west of the southern pattern, had a tendency of wetting in the first 29 years, however, there has been a significant tendency of drying in this region in the last 29 years, which was caused by an abrupt change in 1994. In addition, other patterns had multiple abrupt changes, resulting in multiple transitions between dry and wet states. The principal periods of WI in the southern pattern and northern pattern were longer than the DI, but in other subregions DI was longer than WI. ENSO and AO had the most obvious influence on DI and WI. Compared with the cold phase of ENSO, the DI/WI in the warm phase were higher/lower; compared with the negative phase of AO, both DI and WI were higher in the positive phase. The Hurst index showed that the current dry and wet conditions in the Yangtze River basin have persistent characteristics, the dry conditions in each subregion will continue in the future, and there were a few wetness indicators with weak anti-persistence.},

  abstract = {El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is one of the most important drivers of climatic variability on the global scale. Much of this variability arises in response to ENSO-driven changes in tropical Pacific rainfall. Previous research has shown that the ENSO-driven tropical Pacific rainfall variability can shift east and intensify in response to global warming, even if ENSO-related SST variability remains unchanged. Here, the twenty-first century changes in ENSO-driven tropical Pacific rainfall variability in 32 CMIP5 models forced under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario are examined, revealing that the pattern of changes in ENSO-driven rainfall is not only gradually enhanced but also shifts steadily eastward along with the global-mean temperature increase. Using a recently developed moisture budget decomposition method, it is shown that the projected changes in ENSO-driven rainfall variability in the tropical Pacific can be primarily attributed to a projected increase in both mean-state surface moisture and spatially relative changes in mean-state SST, defined as the departure of local SST changes from the tropical mean. The enhanced moisture increase enlarges the thermodynamic component of ENSO rainfall changes. The enhanced El Ni{\~n}o--like changes in mean-state SST steadily move the dynamic component of changes in ENSO-driven rainfall variability to the central-eastern Pacific, along with increasing global-mean temperature.},

Taking the Yue River watershed in the Qinling Mountains in China as the study area, the Mann--Kendall test and Pettitt mutation test method were used to analyze the various characteristics of hydrological and climatic elements from 1960 to 2018. Then, the elastic coefficient method based on the Budyko framework was used to estimate the elastic coefficient of runoff change on each influencing factor. The results showed that the annual runoff decreased at a rate of 0.038\,{\texttimes}\,108\,m3/a (                                                   P                   {$>$}                   0.05                                               ), and a significant abrupt change occurred in 1990. The annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (ET0) increased and decreased, with change rates of 0.614\,mm/a and -0.811\,mm/a (                                                   P                   {$>$}                   0.05                                               ), respectively. The elasticity coefficients of precipitation, ET0, and the underlying surface were 1.95, -0.95, and -0.85, respectively, indicating that annual runoff was most sensitive to the change in precipitation, followed by the change in ET0, and had the lowest sensitivity to the change in the underlying surface. Underlying surface change is the main factor of runoff decrease; the contribution is 89.07\%. The total contribution of climate change to runoff change is 10.93\%, in which the contributions of precipitation and ET0 are 17.59\% and -6.66\%, respectively. The NDVI reflecting underlying surface change has been increasing since 1990, which is an important reason for the runoff decrease.},

  abstract = {Bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is an effective option for mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Nevertheless, there is barely serious debate about whether its implementation can possibly jeopardize the global water resources security. Here, we provided an assessment of biomass-based Substitute Natural Gas (BioSNG) production combined with CCS, a promising BECCS technology, in terms of global water resources security, with a focus on the growth of two typical second-generation bioenergy crops: switchgrass and miscanthus. A bottom-up analysis approach was applied in this paper to calculating water consumption for BECCS and estimating water quality deterioration caused by increasing fertilizer and pesticide application. The results indicated that water usage of BECCS was equal to adding 12.86\%--16.64\% (switchgrass) and 17.59\%--26.06\% (miscanthus) additional water stress on global available water resources at 2100. Additional N fertilizer application in 2100 would be equal to over 84\%, 55\% and 42\% for both switchgrass and miscanthus under three CCS capture efficiency scenarios, respectively, comparing to such global scale in 2012. Additional phosphate fertilizer adding to global annual available water at 2100 were 0.004--0.008~mg~L-1 (switchgrass) and 0.003--0.006~mg~L-1 (miscanthus), respectively. The secondary environmental hazards, such as N2O emission, would offset GHG emission mitigation by BECCS. Meanwhile, the enrichment and leaching of pesticide residues increased the risk of groundwater contamination. This study revealed water consumption and contamination issues caused by BECCS cannot be neglected. Thus, additional studies of accurate land-use models in global scale and advanced technology for biofuel extraction are needed in the future.},

While an increasing number of case studies have provided a rich overview on regional analyses, a global assessment on the dominant features of GRACE variability is still lacking. To address this, we survey key features of temporal variability in the GRACE record by decomposing gridded time series of monthly equivalent water height into linear trends, inter-annual, seasonal, and subseasonal (intra-annual) components. We provide an overview of the relative importance and spatial distribution of these components globally. A correlation analysis with precipitation and temperature reveals that both the inter-annual and subseasonal anomalies are tightly related to fluctuations in the atmospheric forcing. As a novelty, we show that for large regions of the world high-frequency anomalies in the monthly GRACE signal, which have been partly interpreted as noise, can be statistically reconstructed from daily precipitation once an adequate averaging filter is applied. This filter integrates the temporally decaying contribution of precipitation to the storage changes in any given month, including earlier precipitation. Finally, we also survey extreme dry anomalies in the GRACE record and relate them to documented drought events. This global assessment sets regional studies in a broader context and reveals phenomena that had not been documented so far.},

  abstract = {Monthly streamflow forecasts are needed to support water resources decision making in the South East of South Australia, where baseflow represents a significant proportion of the total streamflow and soil moisture and groundwater are important predictors of runoff. To address this requirement, the utility of a hybrid monthly streamflow forecasting approach is explored, whereby simulated soil moisture from the GR4J conceptual rainfall-runoff model is used to represent initial catchment conditions in a Bayesian artificial neural network (ANN) statistical forecasting model. To assess the performance of this hybrid forecasting method, a comparison is undertaken of the relative performances of the Bayesian ANN, the GR4J conceptual model and the hybrid streamflow forecasting approach for producing 1-month ahead streamflow forecasts at three key locations in the South East of South Australia. Particular attention is paid to the quantification of uncertainty in each of the forecast models and the potential for reducing forecast uncertainty by using the hybrid approach is considered. Case study results suggest that the hybrid models developed in this study are able to take advantage of the complementary strengths of both the ANN models and the GR4J conceptual models. This was particularly the case when forecasting high flows, where the hybrid models were shown to outperform the two individual modelling approaches in terms of the accuracy of the median forecasts, as well as reliability and resolution of the forecast distributions. In addition, the forecast distributions generated by the hybrid models were up to 8 times more precise than those based on climatology; thus, providing a significant improvement on the information currently available to decision makers.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the value of observed river discharge data for global-scale hydrological modeling of a number of flow characteristics that are e.g. required for assessing water resources, flood risk and habitat alteration of aquatic ecosystems. An improved version of the WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) was tuned against measured discharge using either the 724-station dataset (V1) against which former model versions were tuned or an extended dataset (V2) of 1235 stations. WGHM is tuned by adjusting one model parameter (gamma) that affects runoff generation from land areas in order to fit simulated and observed long-term average discharge at tuning stations. In basins where gamma does not suffice to tune the model, two correction factors are applied successively: the areal correction factor corrects local runoff in a basin and the station correction factor adjusts discharge directly the gauge. Using station correction is unfavorable, as it makes discharge discontinuous at the gauge and inconsistent with runoff in the upstream basin. The study results are as follows. (1) Comparing V2 to V1, the global land area covered by tuning basins increases by 5\% and the area where the model can be tuned by only adjusting gamma increases by 8\%. However, the area where a station correction factor (and not only an areal correction factor) has to be applied more than doubles. (2) The value of additional discharge information for representing the spatial distribution of long-term average discharge (and thus renewable water resources) with WGHM is high, particularly for river basins outside of the V1 tuning area and in regions where the refined dataset provides a significant subdivision of formerly extended tuning basins (average V2 basin size less than half the V1 basin size). If the additional discharge information were not used for tuning, simulated long-term average discharge would differ from the observed one by a factor of, on average, 1.8 in the formerly untuned basins and 1.3 in the subdivided basins. The benefits tend to be higher in semi-arid and snow-dominated regions where the model is less reliable than in humid areas and refined tuning compensates for uncertainties with regard to climate input data and for specific processes of the water cycle that cannot be represented yet by WGHM. Regarding other flow characteristics like low flow, inter-annual variability and seasonality, the deviation between simulated and observed values also decreases significantly, which, however, is mainly due to the better representation of average discharge but not of variability. (3) The choice of the optimal sub-basin size for tuning depends on the modeling purpose. While basins over 60 000 km(2) are performing best, improvements in V2 model performance are strongest in small basins between 9000 and 20 000 km(2), which is primarily related to a low level of V1 performance. Increasing the density of tuning stations provides a better spatial representation of discharge, but it also decreases model consistency, as almost half of the basins below 20 000 km(2) require station correction.},

  abstract = {One of the more important questions in hydrology is: if the climate warms in the future, will there be an intensification of the water cycle and, if so, the nature of that intensification? There is considerable interest in this question because an intensification of the water cycle may lead to changes in water-resource availability, an increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical storms, floods, and droughts, and an amplification of warming through the water vapor feedback. Empirical evidence for ongoing intensification of the water cycle would provide additional Support for the theoretical framework that links intensification with warming. This paper briefly reviews the current state of science regarding historical trends in hydrologic variables, including precipitation, runoff, tropospheric water vapor, soil moisture, glacier mass balance, evaporation, evapotranspiration, and growing season length. Data are often incomplete in spatial and temporal domains and regional analyses are variable and sometimes contradictory; however, the weight of evidence indicates an ongoing intensification of the water cycle. In contrast to these trends, the empirical evidence to date does not consistently support an increase in the frequency or intensity of tropical storms and floods.

  abstract = {Understanding the water balance of a catchment in relation to its regional climate forcings and catchment characteristics is critical for predicting current and future water resources amid changing climate and land cover. This study intends to improve Zhang's monthly water balance model (a physics-based conceptual hydrologic model) that reflects the physical partitioning process of the hydrological cycle at the basin level based on regional climate and catchment characteristics. The existing model does not include snow process and has confronted evident limitations in snow-affected areas, which is a critical aspect since snowmelt water has been a significant source of water resources for many regions, especially in the temperate and frigid zones. We introduce a snow module based on surface energy balance and Budyko-limits on melting and combine it with the existing water balance equations. Moreover, monthly parameterization is applied to the model to better explain the time-varying hydrological characteristics of a catchment. The proposed model involves five different monthly parameters, which determine the physical partitioning process of the hydrological cycle, and they are regionally calibrated and validated under Budyko-type constraints. The model is applied to 1,210 basins across the continental United States (CONUS), and the simulated streamflow is compared to the observed data. The proposed model significantly outperformed the original model, improving the median NSE by 31\% (from 0.51 to 0.67) and increasing the number of catchments with an acceptable NSE by 58\%. The spatial variability of the basin characteristics across the CONUS is also investigated based on the calibrated parameters.},

  abstract = {Following large explosive volcanic eruptions, precipitation decreases over much of the globe(1-6), particularly in climatologically wet regions(4,5). Stratospheric volcanic aerosols reflect sunlight, which reduces evaporation, whilst surface cooling stabilizes the atmosphere and reduces its water-holding capacity(7). Circulation changes modulate this global precipitation reduction on regional scales(1,8-10). Despite the importance of rivers to people, it has been unclear whether volcanism causes detectable changes in streamflow, given large natural variability. Here we analyse observational records of streamflow volume for fifty large rivers from around the world that cover between two and six major volcanic eruptions in the twentieth and late nineteenth century. We find statistically significant reductions in flow following eruptions for the Amazon, Congo, Nile, Orange, Ob, Yenisey and Kolyma, amongst others. When data from neighbouring rivers are combined-based on the areas where climate models simulate either an increase or a decrease in precipitation following eruptions-a significant (p {$<$} 0.1) decrease in streamflow following eruptions is detected in northern South American, central African and high-latitude Asian rivers, and on average across wet tropical and subtropical regions. We also detect a significant increase in flow in southern South American and southwestern North American rivers. Our findings suggest that future volcanic eruptions could substantially affect global water availability.},

A huge difference also exists between basins in the extent to which climate change is predicted to affect water availability and food security.

First, a set of polynomial correction factors was derived comparing observed and GCM-derived runoff for a hindcast period (1961-2000) for each of the 11 selected GCMs. The correction factors are used to correct the GCM-derived streamflow for projected periods (2046-2065 and 2081-2100) for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios A2 and B1 (CMIP3) for the Murray-Hotham catchment of Western Australia. The assumption is that the correction factors derived for each GCM for the observed period (1961-2000) are valid for the projected periods. Results show the method reduces biases considerably for the projected runoff at a catchment scale. The method developed here uses CMIP3 data but it may be applicable to any GCM data, such as CMIP5/CMIP6.},

A popular example is the series of reference regions used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Adaptation (SREX). The SREX regions were slightly modified for the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC and used for reporting subcontinental observed and projected changes over a reduced number (33) of climatologically consistent regions encompassing a representative number of grid boxes. These regions are intended to allow analysis of atmospheric data over broad land or ocean regions and have been used as the basis for several popular spatially aggregated datasets, such as the Seasonal Mean Temperature and Precipitation in IPCC Regions for CMIP5 dataset. We present an updated version of the reference regions for the analysis of new observed and simulated datasets (including CMIP6) which offer an opportunity for refinement due to the higher atmospheric model resolution. As a result, the number of land and ocean regions is increased to 46 and 15, respectively, better representing consistent regional climate features. The paper describes the rationale for the definition of the new regions and analyses their homogeneity. The regions are defined as polygons and are provided as coordinates and a shapefile together with companion R and Python notebooks to illustrate their use in practical problems (e.g. calculating regional averages). We also describe the generation of a new dataset with monthly temperature and precipitation, spatially aggregated in the new regions, currently for CMIP5 and CMIP6, to be extended to other datasets in the future (including observations). The use of these reference regions, dataset and code is illustrated through a worked example using scatter plots to offer guidance on the likely range of future climate change at the scale of the reference regions. The regions, datasets and code (R and Python notebooks) are freely available at the ATLAS GitHub repository: https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/ATLAS (last access: 24 August 2020), https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3998463 (Iturbide et al., 2020).},

  abstract = {Over the last few decades, increasing rates of change in the structure and function of ecosystems have been brought about by human modification of land cover, of which a major component is vegetation. Metrics derived from linear regression models applied to high temporal resolution satellite data are commonly used to estimate rates of vegetation change. This approach implicitly assumes that vegetation changes gradually and linearly, which may not always be the case. In order to account for non-linear change in annual observations of vegetation from satellites, we test and apply a polynomial fitting-based scheme to annual GIMMS (Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies)--NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) observations for North Africa (including the Sahel) for the period 1982--2006. The scheme divides vegetation change into cubic, quadratic, linear, and ``concealed'' trend behaviors, the latter indicating that while no net change in vegetation amount has occurred over the period, the curve exhibits at least one minimum or/and maximum indicating that the vegetation has undergone change during the elapsed time period. Our results show that just over half the study area (51.9\%) exhibit trends that are statistically significant, with a dominance of positive linear trends (22.2\%) that are distributed in an east-west band across the Sahel, thus confirming previous studies. Non-linear trends occur much less frequently and are more widely scattered. Nevertheless, they tend to cluster within or on the outskirts of zones of linear trend, underscoring their importance for detecting anomalous change features. We also show that the ratio of linear vs. non-linear trends tends to be associated with different land cover types/land cover change estimates, many of which reflect biome-level controls on vegetation dynamics. However, more local drivers related to direct human impact, such as urbanization, cannot be ruled out. Our change detection approach retains the more complex signatures embedded in long-term time series by preserving details about change rates, therefore allowing for a more subtle interpretation of change trajectories on a case-by-case basis. The fitting method is entirely automated and does not require the judicious selection of thresholds. However, while polynomials can give a better fit, they like linear models are based on assumptions, and may sometimes lead to oversimplification or miss short-term variations. Our method can help to contribute more accurate information to one of the major goals of the burgeoning field of land change science, namely to observe and monitor land changes underway throughout the world.},

  abstract = {Although satellite-based sensors have made vegetation data series available for several decades, the detection of vegetation trend and change is not yet straightforward. This is partly due to the scarcity of available change detection algorithms suitable for identifying and characterizing both abrupt and non-abrupt changes, without sacrificing accuracy or computational speed. We propose a user-friendly program for analysing vegetation time series, with two main application domains: generalising vegetation trends to main features, and characterizing vegetation trend changes. This program, Detecting Breakpoints and Estimating Segments in Trend (DBEST) uses a novel segmentation algorithm which simplifies the trend into linear segments using one of three user-defined parameters: a generalisation-threshold parameter {$\delta$}, the m largest changes, or a threshold {$\beta$} for the magnitude of changes of interest for detection. The outputs of DBEST are the simplified trend, the change type (abrupt or non-abrupt), and estimates for the characteristics (time and magnitude) of the change. DBEST was tested and evaluated using simulated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data at two sites, which included different types of changes. Evaluation results demonstrate that DBEST quickly and robustly detects both abrupt and non-abrupt changes, and accurately estimates change time and magnitude. DBEST was also tested using data from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) NDVI image time series for Iraq for the period 1982--2006, and was able to detect and quantify major change over the area. This showed that DBEST is able to detect and characterize changes over large areas. We conclude that DBEST is a fast, accurate and flexible tool for trend detection, and is applicable to global change studies using time series of remotely sensed data sets.},

  abstract = {During the last 6 decades, forest biomass has increased in Sweden mainly due to forest management, with a possible increasing effect on evapotranspiration. However, increasing global CO2 concentrations may also trigger physiological water-saving responses in broadleaf tree species, and to a lesser degree in some needleleaf conifer species, inducing an opposite effect. Additionally, changes in other forest attributes may also affect evapotranspiration. In this study, we aimed to detect the dominating effect(s) of forest change on evapotranspiration by studying changes in the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation, known as the evaporative ratio, during the period 1961--2012. We first used the Budyko framework of water and energy availability at the basin scale to study the hydroclimatic movements in Budyko space of 65 temperate and boreal basins during this period. We found that movements in Budyko space could not be explained by climatic changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in 60 \% of these basins, suggesting the existence of other dominant drivers of hydroclimatic change. In both the temperate and boreal basin groups studied, a negative climatic effect on the evaporative ratio was counteracted by a positive residual effect. The positive residual effect occurred along with increasing standing forest biomass in the temperate and boreal basin groups, increasing forest cover in the temperate basin group and no apparent changes in forest species composition in any group. From the three forest attributes, standing forest biomass was the one that could explain most of the variance of the residual effect in both basin groups. These results further suggest that the water-saving response to increasing CO2 in these forests is either negligible or overridden by the opposite effect of the increasing forest biomass. Thus, we conclude that increasing standing forest biomass is the dominant driver of long-term and large-scale evapotranspiration changes in Swedish forests.},

The question is if basins will deviate or follow their Budyko curves under the future effects of global warming and related human developments. To answer this, we quantify the movement in the Budyko space of 405 river basins from 1901-1950 to 2051-2100 based on the outputs of seven models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project - Phase 6 (CMIP6). We account for the implications of using different potential evaporation models and study low- and high-emissions scenarios. We find considerable differences of movement in Budyko space regarding direction and intensity when using the two estimates of potential evaporation. However, regardless of the potential evaporation estimate and the scenario used, most river basins will not follow their reference Budyko curves ({$>$}72\%). Furthermore, the number of basins not following their curves increases under high greenhouse gas emissions and fossil-fueled development SP585 and across dry and wet basin groups. We elaborate on the possible explanations for a large number of basins not following their Budyko curves.},

Globally, we find consistent and dominant effects of increasing relative evapotranspiration from both activities, and decreasing temporal runoff variability from flow regulation. The evapotranspiration effect increases the long-term average human consumption of fresh water by 3563 +/- 979 km(3)/year from 1901-1954 to 1955-2008. This increase raises a recent estimate of the current global water footprint of humanity by around 18\%, to 10,688 +/- 979 km(3)/year.

  abstract = {Tibetan lakes are an effective indicator of climate change as they are highly sensitive to and directly affected by climate change. The past decade has seen the seven warmest years on record globally. Such observations have prompted questions about lake changes over the Tibetan Plateau. The dense coverage of the CryoSat-2 altimeter reveals large-scale patterns in this climate change signal. We investigate lake level variations of more than 200 lakes using altimetry observations from CryoSat-2 during the period 2010 to 2019. Combined with GRACE/GRACE-FO, we evaluate the water storage change of lakes and terrestrial water storage (TWS). We find that most studied lakes generally went through three phases of change, that is, rising-hiatus/decline-rising, albeit lakes in the north Tibetan Plateau, show higher rising rates. Results also show that lake levels are widely affected by the 2015/16 El Nino event across the entire Inner Plateau via reduced precipitation. Above normal precipitation during 2016-2018, resulted in a sharp rise of similar to 1.22 m on average, accounting for 56\% of the decadal lake level rise (mean/median: 2.19/1.85 m). TWS in the Inner Tibetan Plateau accumulated a net gain of 70.5 km(3), which is dominated by the net gain of lake water storage (ca. 63.3 km(3)). The interannual TWS variation is found to be associated mainly with precipitation. In particular, extreme conditions such as the 2015/16 El Nino, had a profound negative impact on the TWS. The findings in this study shed new light on the response of Tibetan lakes to recent decadal environmental changes.},

The initial satellite precipitation data comparisons show that the reanalyzed 3B42V6, with a bias of -4.54\%, matched best with the rain gauge observations, while the two near real-time satellite datasets (3B42RT and CMORPH) largely underestimated precipitation by 42.72\% and 40.81\% respectively. With the model parameters first benchmarked by the rain gauge data, the behavior of the streamflow simulation from the 3B42V6 was also the most optimal amongst the three products, while the two near real-time satellite datasets produced deteriorated biases and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients (NSCEs). Still, when the model parameters were recalibrated by each individual satellite data, the performance of the streamflow simulations from the two near real-time satellite products were significantly improved, thus demonstrating the need for specific calibrations of the hydrological models for the near real-time satellite inputs. Moreover, when optimally merged with respect to the streamflows forced by the two near real-time satellite precipitation products and all the three satellite precipitation products using the Bayesian model averaging method, the resulted streamflow series further improved and became more robust. In summary, the three current state-of-the-art satellite precipitation products have demonstrated potential in hydrological research and applications. The benchmarking, recalibration, and optimal merging schemes for streamflow simulation at a basin scale described in the present work will hopefully be a reference for future utilizations of satellite precipitation products in global and regional hydrological applications. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Understanding vegetation evolution is critical for exploring changes in terrestrial ecosystems and identifying future challenges. However, analyses that simultaneously examine trend shifts in vegetation greenness at the national, regional, biome, and pixel scales in China are still rare. Using long-term (1982-2015) satellite data and the breaks for additive season and trend (BFAST) technique, we identified breakpoints in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in China. The results showed that the annual mean NDVI gradually increased. A total of 68.8\% of the vegetated area exhibited upward trends in NDVI, most of which was distributed in Southeast China and the Loess Plateau. Changes in NDVI trends occurred in 78.7\% of the total vegetated areas, while hotspots were concentrated in Northwest and North China. A rapid increase in breakpoints was detected after 1999, mainly concentrated in North and Northwest China, and corresponding to the times and areas with the highest ecological engineering efforts. Positive shifts in NDVI trends were more common and generally distributed on the eastern side of the Hu Huanyong line, while browning (negative) shifts were mainly distributed on the western side and were gradually expanding, indicating a possible tendency toward environmental degradation. Although unstable vegetation areas that underwent land cover type changes had higher frequencies of breakpoints, the proportion of stable vegetation experiencing NDVI trend shifts was higher after 2000, probably because human intervention buffered external disturbances in unstable areas. Identifying hotspot areas of shifts in vegetation greenness can help setting priorities when taking measures for ecosystem conservation, thus provide scientific reference for sustainable land development.},

  abstract = {Much attention has recently been focused on the effects that climate variability and human activities have had on runoff. In this study, these effects are quantified using three methods, namely, multi-regression, hydrologic sensitivity analysis, and hydrologic model simulation. A conceptual framework is defined to separate the effects. As an example, the change in annual runoff from the semiarid Laohahe basin (18 112 km2) in northern China was investigated. Non-parametric Mann-Kendall test, Pettitt test, and precipitation-runoff double cumulative curve method were adopted to identify the trends and change-points in the annual runoff from 1964 to 2008 by first dividing the long-term runoff series into a natural period (1964--1979) and a human-induced period (1980--2008). Then the three quantifying methods were calibrated and calculated, and they provided consistent estimates of the percentage change in mean annual runoff for the human-induced period. In 1980--2008, human activities were the main factors that reduced runoff with contributions of 89--93\%, while the reduction percentages due to changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration only ranged from 7 to 11\%. For the various effects at different durations, human activities were the main reasons runoff decreased during the two drier periods of 1980--1989 and 2000--2008. Increased runoff during the wetter period of 1990--1999 is mainly attributed to climate variability. This study quantitatively separates the effects of climate variability and human activities on runoff, which can serve as a reference for regional water resources assessment and management.

  abstract = {Climate change has significantly affected the ecosystem of the Tibetan Plateau. There, temperature rises and altered precipitation patterns have led to notable changes in its vegetation growth processes and vegetation cover features. Yet current research still pays relatively little attention to the regional climatic determinants and response patterns of such vegetation dynamics. In this study, spatial patterns in the response of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to climate change and its dynamic characteristics during the growing season were examined for the Tibetan Plateau, by using a pixel-scale-based geographically weighted regression (GWR) based on the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) NDVI data, as well as data for temperature and moisture indices collected at meteorological stations, for the period 1982-2015. The results show the following. Spatial nonstationary relationships, primarily positive, were found between the NDVI and climatic factors in the Tibetan Plateau. However, warming adversely affected vegetation growth and cover in some arid and semiarid regions of the northeast and west Tibetan Plateau. Additionally, precipitation played a dominant role in the NDVI of the Tibetan Plateau in the largest area (accounting for 39.7\% of total area). This suggests that increased moisture conditions considerably facilitated vegetation growth and cover in these regions during the study period. Temperature mainly played a dominant role in the NDVI in some parts of the plateau sub-cold zone and some southeastern regions of the Tibetan Plateau. In particular, the minimum temperature was the dominant driver of NDVI over a larger area than any of the other temperature indices. Furthermore, spatial regressions between NDVI dynamics and climatic variability revealed that a faster warming rate in the arid and semiarid regions impeded vegetation growth through mechanisms such as drought intensification. Moisture variability was found to act as a key factor regulating the extent of vegetation cover on the south Tibetan Plateau.},

This paper reviews the changes in air temperature and precipitation over the past 60 years and presents the distribution and degradation of alpine permafrost in the SAYR. The review is focused on the permafrost degradation-induced changes in hydrology, wetlands, thermokarst lakes, ponds, and vegetation. Mean annual air temperatures have been rising at an average rate of 0.4 degrees C/10a over the past 60 years, while precipitation has increased only slightly (16 mm/10a). Borehole temperature monitoring at the depth of 15 m shows the permafrost warming rates of 0.01-0.21 degrees C/10a in the Headwater Aera of the Yellow River. As a result of permafrost thaw, the amount of surface waters has declined while groundwater storage has increased. Due to permafrost degradation, the supra-permafrost water table lowers gradually, resulting in a reduction in areal extents of wetlands and lakes in the SAYR. We further renamed the concept of the burial depth of the ecologically-safe supra-permafrost water table, the minimum depth of the groundwater table for sustaining the normal growth of alpine grassland vegetation, for the SAYR to describe the relationship between the lowering permafrost table and succeeding alpine vegetation. Furthermore, we recommended more studies focusing on snow cover and carbon stock and emissions related to permafrost degradation under a warming climate. We also advised to timely establish the long-term monitoring networks for the rapidly changing mountain cryosphere, alpine ecology, alpine hydrology, eco-hydrology, cryo-hydrogeology, and carbon fluxes. Moreover, process-based models should be developed and improved to better simulate and predict the responses of alpine ecosystem changes to the interacting cryospheric and other environmental variables and their ecological and ecohydrological impacts in the SAYR and downstream Yellow River basins. This study can help better manage the ecological and hydrological environments in the Upper Yellow River that are sensitive to changes in the alpine climate and cryosphere.},

Plateau mountainous areas have not only a unique hydrological cycle mechanism but also are sensitive to climate change. Glacier and snow meltwater in the plateau mountainous areas have a large proportion in runoff and are a main water resources for industrial, agricultural and domestic water use in the basin. Two commonly used model, HBV and SRM, were selected for the quantitative analysis of snowmelt runoff contribution and the hydrological response to climate change scenarios in the Nyang River Basin in the southeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Based on the characteristics of the models, the HBV model was used to analyze the runoff composition, while the SRM model was used to analyze the runoff in climate change scenarios. The results showed that both models have a good performance in modeling the hydrological processes in the basin. The snow melts mainly concentrate in May, in the average annual precipitation, rainfall and snowfall accounted for 85\% and 15\%, respectively. From the results of sensitivity analysis, the increase in temperature would accelerate the melting of snow in April and May and turns the snowfall into rainfall in October. However, the change in precipitation mainly affects the runoff in July, August and September, when precipitation is dominated by rain. The results indicate that the timing of the effects of temperature and precipitation on the runoff process is different.},

  abstract = {Comprehending the impacts of climate change on regional hydrology and future projections of water supplies is of great value to manage the water resources in the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin (YZRB). However, large uncertainties from both input data and the model itself exert obstacles to accurate projections. In this work, a hydrological modeling framework was established over the YZRB linking the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) with an empirical formulation, called the degree-day glacier-melt scheme (VIC-Glacier). The model performance was evaluated through three aspects, including streamflow, snow cover area, and glacier area. Nine GCM models and three emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5) in CMIP6 were chosen to drive the calibrated VIC-Glacier model. The results showed that both precipitation and temperature resulted in an increase of around 25\% and 13\%, respectively, in multi-year average runoff from June to September, under SSP5-8.5 and SSP1-2.6. The precipitation runoff was projected to increase, as compensation for the decrease of glacier runoff and snow runoff by the end of the 21st century. An apparent increasing trend in the runoff was expected over the YZRB before 2050 and after the year 2060 under SSP 5-8.5, with a steeply decreasing trend from 2050 to 2060, and a negligible decreasing trend under SSP1-2.6 from 2020 to 2060, in contrast to an increasing trend from 2060 to 2100.},

  abstract = {The process controls on water balance are examined at the annual, monthly and daily scales. A systematic 'downward' approach for the formulation of models of appropriate complexity is presented based on an investigation of the climate, soil and vegetation controls on water balance. Starting with a simple model, complexity is added in steps, with the models tested progressively against signatures of runoff variability at each time scale. The inter-annual variability of runoff is the first signature considered, followed by the intra-annual (mean monthly) variation of runoff. The flow duration curve is the third key signature and is used to test predictions of the daily water balance model. These analyses are carried out using observed data from the Collie River Basin in Western Australia. At the annual time scale, a simple water balance model including saturation excess overland flow and evaporation is found adequate, provided spatial variability of soil depths and rainfall are introduced through multiple buckets. At the monthly time scale, additional processes are required-the key process is subsurface runoff, but in our case we also separated total evapotranspiration into bare soil evaporation and transpiration to represent the heterogeneous vegetation cover. At the daily time scale, inclusion of non-linearity in the storage-discharge relationship for subsurface runoff generation was important, and more crucially, the inclusion of a deeper groundwater store to capture prolonged low flows was important. Model predictions were very sensitive to the assumed distribution of soil depths, both within each subcatchment, and between subcatchments on a regional basis. Streamflow routing was important for large catchments to capture high flows. The overall conclusion is that in this semi-arid catchment. spatial variability of soil depths appear to be the most important control on runoff variability at all time and space scales, followed by the spatial variability of climate and vegetation cover.

Here, we systematically analyzed the trend of the difference between satellite-based Ts and station-based Ta (Ts--Ta) over 2003--2022. We found the global land warming rate inffered from Ts was on average 42.6\% slower than that from Ta (Ts--Ta trend: -0.011 {$^\circ$}C yr-1, p = 0.06) during daytime of summer. This slower Ts-based warming was attributed to recent Earth greening, which effectively cooled canopy surface through enhancing evapotranspiration and turbulent heat transfer. However, Ts showed faster warming than Ta during summer nighttime (0.015 {$^\circ$}C yr-1, p {$<$} 0.01), winter daytime (0.0069 {$^\circ$}C yr-1, p = 0.08) and winter nighttime (0.0042 {$^\circ$}C yr-1, p = 0.16), when vegetation activity is limited by temperature and solar radiation.

  abstract = {Climate change is the most important problem of the earth in the current century. In this study, the effects of climate change on precipitation, temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and surface runoff in Saghez watershed in Iran investigated. The main methods were using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model under the Shared Socio-economic Pathway scenarios (SSPs) using the Linear Scaling Bias Correction (LSBC) for the future period (2021-2050) compared to the base period (1985-2014). Additionally, MAE, MSE, RMSE and R2 indices used for model calibration and validation. The average projected precipitation was forecasted to decrease by 6.1\%. In terms of the temperature, 1.4 Co, and 1.6 Co increases were predicted for minimum and maximum temperatures, respectively. Prediction of surface runoff using the SWAT model also illustrated that based on SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, runoff will decrease in the future period, which based on three mentioned scenarios is equals to 17.5\%, 23.7\% and 26.3\% decrease, respectively. Furthermore, the assessment using the artificial neural network (ANN) also showed that the parameters of precipitation in the previous two days, wind speed and maximum relative humidity have the greatest effect on the watershed runoff. These findings may be helpful to reduce the impacts of climate change, and make the suitable long-term plans for management of the watersheds and water resources in the region.},

The objective of this study was to model the combined effect of land use and climate changes on hydrology for a 486km2 catchment in Denmark and to evaluate the sensitivity of the results to the choice of hydrological model. Three hydrological models, NAM, SWAT and MIKE SHE, were constructed and calibrated using similar methods. Each model was forced with results from four climate models and four land use scenarios. The results revealed that even though the hydrological models all showed similar performance during calibration, the mean discharge response to climate change varied up to 30\%, and the variations were even higher for extreme events (1th and 99th percentile). Land use changes appeared to cause little change in mean hydrological responses and little variation between hydrological models. Differences in hydrological model responses to land use were, however, significant for extremes due to dissimilarities in hydrological model structure and process equations. The climate model choice remained the dominant factor for mean discharge, low and high flows as well as hydraulic head at the end of the century.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the analysis of abrupt and non-abrupt changes in precipitation has received much attention due to the importance of climate change-related issues (e.g., extreme climate events). In this study, we used a novel segmentation algorithm, DBEST (Detecting Breakpoints and Estimating Segments in Trend), to analyze the greatest changes in precipitation using a monthly pixel-based satellite precipitation dataset (TRMM 3B43) at three different scales: (i) global, (ii) continental, and (iii) climate zone, during the 1998--2019 period. We found significant breakpoints, 14.1\%, both in the form of abrupt and non-abrupt changes, in the global scale precipitation at the 0.05 significance level. Most of the abrupt changes were observed near the Equator in the Pacific Ocean and Asian continent, relative to the rest of the globe. Most detected breakpoints occurred during the 1998--1999 and 2009--2011 periods on the global scale. The average precipitation change for the detected breakpoint was {\textpm}100 mm, with some regions reaching {\textpm}3000 mm. For instance, most portions of northern Africa and Asia experienced major changes of approximately +100 mm. In contrast, most of the South Pacific and South Atlantic Ocean experienced changes of -100 mm during the studied period. Our findings indicated that the larger areas of Africa (23.9\%), Asia (22.9\%), and Australia (15.4\%) experienced significant precipitation breakpoints compared to North America (11.6\%), South America (9.3\%), Europe (8.3\%), and Oceania (9.6\%). Furthermore, we found that the majority of detected significant breakpoints occurred in the arid (31.6\%) and polar (24.1\%) climate zones, while the least significant breakpoints were found for snow-covered (11.5\%), equatorial (7.5\%), and warm temperate (7.7\%) climate zones. Positive breakpoints' temporal coverage in the arid (54.0\%) and equatorial (51.9\%) climates were more than those in other climates zones. Here, the findings indicated that large areas of Africa and Asia experienced significant changes in precipitation (-250 to +250 mm). Compared to the average state (trend during a specific period), the greatest changes in precipitation were more abrupt and unpredictable, which might impose a severe threat to the ecology, environment, and natural resources.},

Although, much research has been conducted on analyzing precipitation patterns and variation at the global scale, trend types have still not received much attention. This study developed a new polynomial-based model for detecting nonlinear and linear trends in a satellite precipitation product (TRMM 3B43) for the 1998-2017 period at a near-global scale. We used an automated trend classification method that detects significant trends and classifies them into linear and nonlinear (cubic, quadratic, and concealed) trend types in satellite-based precipitation at near-global, continental, and climate zone scales. We found that 12.3\% of pixel-based precipitation time series across the globe have significant trend at 0.05 significance level (50\% positive and 50\% negative trends). In all continents except Asia, decreasing trends were found to cover larger areas than corresponding increasing trends. Regarding climate zone and precipitation trend change, our results indicate that a linear trend is dominant in the warm temperate (77.7\%) and equatorial climates (80.4\%) while the least linear change was detected in the polar climate (68.9\%). The combined results of continental and climate zone scales indicate significant increasing trends in Asia and arid climate over the last 20 yr. Furthermore, positive trends were found to be more significant at the continental scale, particularly, in Asia relative to the climate zone scale. Linear change in precipitation (80\%) was the most dominant trend observed as opposed to nonlinear (quadratic [11\%] and cubic [9\%]) trend types at the global scale.},

To robustly assess the 21st century climate change impact for hydrology in entire High Mountain Asia (HMA) at a wide range of scales, we use a high resolution cryospheric-hydrological model covering 15 upstream HMA basins to quantify the compound effects of future changes in precipitation and temperature based on the range of climate change projections in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate model ensemble. Our analysis reveals contrasting responses for HMA's rivers, dictated by their hydrological regimes. At the seasonal scale, the earlier onset of melting causes a shift in the magnitude and peak of water availability, to earlier in the year. At the decade to century scale, after an initial increase, the glacier melt declines by the mid or end of the century except for the Tarim river basin, where it continues to increase. Despite a large variability in hydrological regimes across HMA's rivers, our results indicate relatively consistent climate change responses across HMA in terms of total water availability at decadal time scales. Although total water availability increases for the headwaters, changes in seasonality and magnitude may diverge widely between basins and need to be addressed while adapting to future changes in a region where food security, energy security as well as biodiversity, and the livelihoods of many depend on water from HMA.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty analysis is an integral part of any scientific modeling, particularly within the domain of hydrological sciences given the various types and sources of uncertainty. At the center of uncertainty rests the concept of equifinality, that is, reaching a given endpoint (finality) through different pathways. The operational definition of equifinality in hydrological modeling is that various model structures and/or parameter sets (i.e., equal pathways) are equally capable of reproducing a similar (not necessarily identical) hydrological outcome (i.e., finality). Here we argue that there is more to model equifinality than model structures/parameters, that is, other model components can give rise to model equifinality and/or could be used to explore equifinality within model space. We identified six facets of model equifinality, namely, model structure, parameters, performance metrics, initial and boundary conditions, inputs, and internal fluxes. Focusing on model internal fluxes, we developed a methodology called flux mapping that has fundamental implications in understanding and evaluating model process representation within the paradigm of multiple working hypotheses. To illustrate this, we examine the equifinality of runoff fluxes of a conceptual rainfall-runoff model for a number of different Australian catchments. We demonstrate how flux maps can give new insights into the model behavior that cannot be captured by conventional model evaluation methods. We discuss the advantages of flux space, as a subspace of the model space not usually examined, over parameter space. We further discuss the utility of flux mapping in hypothesis generation and testing, extendable to any field of scientific modeling of open complex systems under uncertainty.},

Evaporation estimated using the Bowen ratio energy budget method has been considered as actual evaporation. Results show that the pan coefficient for the study area varies significantly both by month and season. The month-wise variation is in the range of 0.72-1.40 and the seasonal variation is in the range of 0.81-1.16. Pan coefficients obtained using various existing models such as Cuenca, Snyder, Modified Snyder, Pereira, Orang, FAO-56 and Wahed-Snyder have also been compared with the developed coefficients. Comparative analysis indicates that the pan coefficients obtained using the Snyder model overestimate evaporation significantly, while the rest of the models significantly underestimate evaporation. The study concludes that the developed pan coefficients are observed to estimate the open-water surface evaporation with a fair degree of accuracy for the study area while the pan coefficient value of 0.7 being used by most field organisations in India give high errors. However, since pan coefficients vary spatially due to the variation in the relative significance of various meteorological parameters, the pan coefficients developed in the present study need to be further evaluated for their suitability to other similar climatic regions of India.},

The key to successfully predict runoff and its fluctuation in both gauged and ungauged basins is a reliable hydrologic model and an appropriate parameter regionalization approach. The Upper Blue Nile River Basin of Ethiopia is an example where data are limited, water resources are valuable, and competition for water among riparian countries is strong. To predict runoff variability from the basin as well as from ungauged subbasins, a water balance model with six parameters was tested. The model parameters were identified through a sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo experiments and their plausible search ranges were constrained. Six parameter regionalization methods (global mean, subbasin mean, multiple regression, regional calibration, aggregated calibration, and volume fraction calibration) were evaluated by model performance, volume error, and runoff volume fractions of subbasins. The results showed that the high interdependency of model parameters affects the development of regional relationships. The model parameters regionalized in different basin scales were not transferable to one another due to different basin responses. The study found that regional calibration is suitable for simulating runoff of sites (100--10,000km2), and volume fraction calibration is suitable for subbasins (14,000--50,000km2). Lumped calibration managed to simulate runoff dynamics of lumped basins (65,000--180,000km2) representing two or more aggregated subbasins.},

  abstract = {An extension of TOPMODEL was developed for rainfall-runoff simulation in agricultural watersheds equipped with tile drains. Tile drain functions are incorporated into the framework of TOPMODEL. Nine possible flow generation scenarios are suggested for tile-drained watersheds and applied in the modelling procedure. In the model development, two methods of simulation of the flow in the unsaturated zone were compared: the traditional, physically based storage approach and a new approach using a transfer function. A regionalized sensitivity analysis was used to determine the sensitivity of parameters and to compare the behaviour of the transfer function with that of the simple storage-related formulation. The number of accepted combinations of parameter values, on average, was higher for the transfer function approach than when using a Monte Carlo method of parameter estimation. Since the rainfall-runoff response pattern tends to vary seasonally, seven events distributed throughout a year were used in the sensitivity analysis to investigate the seasonal variation of the hydrological characteristics.

Large-sample studies provide insights into the hydrological cycle that might not be available with small-scale studies. LamaH-CE (LArge-SaMple DAta for Hydrology and Environmental Sciences for Central Europe, LamaH for short; the geographical extension "-CE" is omitted in the text and the dataset) is a new dataset for large-sample studies and comparative hydrology in Central Europe. It covers the entire upper Danube to the state border of Austria-Slovakia, as well as all other Austrian catchments including their foreign upstream areas. LamaH covers an area of about 170 000 km(2) in nine countries, ranging from lowland regions characterized by a continental climate to high alpine zones dominated by snow and ice. Consequently, a wide diversity of properties is present in the individual catchments. We represent this variability in 859 gauged catchments with over 60 catchment attributes, covering topography, climatology, hydrology, land cover, vegetation, soil and geological properties. LamaH further contains a collection of runoff time series as well as meteorological time series. These time series are provided with a daily and hourly resolution. All meteorological and the majority of runoff time series cover a span of over 35 years, which enables long-term analyses with a high temporal resolution. The runoff time series are classified by over 20 attributes including information about human impacts and indicators for data quality and completeness. The structure of LamaH is based on the well-known CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies) datasets. In contrast, however, LamaH does not only consider independent basins, covering the full upstream area. Intermediate catchments are covered as well, which allows together with novel attributes the considering of the hydrological network and river topology in applications. We not only describe the basic datasets used and methodology of data preparation but also focus on possible limitations and uncertainties. LamaH contains additionally results of a conceptual hydrological baseline model for checking plausibility of the inputs as well as benchmarking. Potential applications of LamaH are outlined as well, since it is intended to serve as a uniform data basis for further research.},

  abstract = {In mountainous regions of mid latitudes, the accumulation and melting of snow plays an important role for the seasonal water balance. These processes not only exhibit a strong seasonality, but also a high spatial variability, which has to be accounted for when establishing distributed water balances in alpine environments. A methodology was developed for seasonal, spatially distributed modelling of accumulation and melting of snow and was embedded in a water balance model that uses only monthly values of precipitation and air temperature as meteorological input data. Hence, this methodology can also be applied in regions with limited data availability. The model uses a conceptual approach with a spatial resolution of a 1 km {\texttimes} 1 km raster. Snow accumulation is computed from temperature and precipitation data. Snowmelt is computed with a temperature-index approach. A direct application of these simple concepts using monthly inputs would not yield satisfying results. Therefore, precipitation is disaggregated into rainfall and snowfall by using a transition range considering temporal variations of temperature within a month and the mean deviation of temperature on days with and without precipitation. For modelling snowmelt, two different approaches were tested to incorporate variable temperatures within a month. The model was applied for the whole of Austria (84 000 km2) and simulated runoff was compared with observed runoff at 135 gauges for a 30 year period. The model performs best in high and medium mountainous catchments. Lower model performances are achieved in lowland catchments, where the contribution of snowmelt to river runoff decreases. It can be concluded that modelling accumulation and melting of snow in mountainous areas with monthly data yields good results if a temporal disaggregation of precipitation and temperature is applied.

We discuss the implications of both approaches in terms of credibility of simulated hydrological indicators for climate change adaptation. For that, we discuss and confirm the hypothesis that a good performance of hydrological models in the historical period increases confidence in projected impacts under climate change, and decreases uncertainty of projections related to hydrological models. Based on this, we find the second approach more trustworthy and recommend using it for impact assessment, especially if results are intended to support adaptation strategies. Guidelines for evaluation of global- and basin-scale models in the historical period, as well as criteria for model rejection from an ensemble as an outlier, are also suggested.},

  abstract = {Benchmarking model performance across large samples of catchments is useful to guide model selection and future model development. Given uncertainties in the observational data we use to drive and evaluate hydrological models, and uncertainties in the structure and parameterisation of models we use to produce hydrological simulations and predictions, it is essential that model evaluation is undertaken within an uncertainty analysis framework. Here, we benchmark the capability of several lumped hydrological models across Great Britain by focusing on daily flow and peak flow simulation. Four hydrological model structures from the Framework for Understanding Structural Errors (FUSE) were applied to over 1000 catchments in England, Wales and Scotland. Model performance was then evaluated using standard performance metrics for daily flows and novel performance metrics for peak flows considering parameter uncertainty.  Our results show that lumped hydrological models were able to produce adequate simulations across most of Great Britain, with each model producing simulations exceeding a 0.5 Nash--Sutcliffe efficiency for at least 80\&thinsp;\% of catchments. All four models showed a similar spatial pattern of performance, producing better simulations in the wetter catchments to the west and poor model performance in central Scotland and south-eastern England. Poor model performance was often linked to the catchment water balance, with models unable to capture the catchment hydrology where the water balance did not close. Overall, performance was similar between model structures, but different models performed better for different catchment characteristics and metrics, as well as for assessing daily or peak flows, leading to the ensemble of model structures outperforming any single structure, thus demonstrating the value of using multi-model structures across a large sample of different catchment behaviours.  This research evaluates what conceptual lumped models can achieve as a performance benchmark and provides interesting insights into where and why these simple models may fail. The large number of river catchments included in this study makes it an appropriate benchmark for any future developments of a national model of Great Britain.},

  abstract = {Spatial parameter fields are required to model hydrological processes across diverse landscapes. Transfer functions are often used to relate parameters to spatial catchment attributes, introducing large uncertainties. Quantifying these uncertainties remains a key challenge for large-scale modeling. This paper extends the multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR) technique to consider parameter uncertainties. We evaluate this method of producing nationally consistent parameter fields, which maintain a constant relationship between model parameters and catchment attributes, across 437 catchments in Great Britain (GB). By sampling multiple transfer function parameters, we produce thousands of possible model parameter fields which are constrained within an uncertainty framework. This is compared to spatially homogeneous parameter sets constrained for individual catchments. The nationally consistent MPR parameter fields perform well (KGE* {$>$} 0.75) across 60\% of catchments. Performance is similar or better than catchment-constrained parameters (KGE* drop {$<$} 0.1) across 82\% of catchments. Advantages of our national parameter fields include (a) improved representation of flows within catchments, (b) more robust performance between calibration and evaluation periods, and (c) spatial parameter fields reflecting hydrologically meaningful variation in catchment characteristics. By including uncertainties, we show that hydrographs produced using MPR have smaller uncertainty bounds which are better able to encompass flows. As the first application of MPR to both the DECIPHeR modeling framework and GB, we developed transfer functions and identified key catchment attributes to constrain model parameters, which are transferrable to other models alongside the addition of uncertainty. Methodologies presented here are informative for future regionalization efforts in GB and elsewhere.},

  abstract = {Between 1979 and 2021, global ocean regions experienced a decrease in dry season precipitation, while the trend over land areas varied considerably. Some regions, such as southeastern China, the Maritime Continent, eastern Europe, and eastern North America, showed a slight increasing trend in dry season precipitation. This study analyzes the potential mechanisms behind this trend by using the fifth major global reanalysis produced by ECMWF (ERA5) data. The analysis shows that the weakening of downward atmospheric motions played a critical role in enhancing dry season precipitation over land. An atmospheric moisture budget analysis revealed that larger convergent moisture fluxes lead to an increase in water vapor content below 400 hPa. This, in turn, induced an unstable tendency in the moist static energy profile, leading to a more unstable atmosphere and weakening downward motions, which drove the trend toward increasing dry season precipitation over land. More water vapor in the low troposphere is because of higher moisture convergence and moisture transport from ocean to land regions. In summary, this study demonstrates the intricate elements involved in altering dry season rainfall trends over land, which also emphasizes the importance of comprehending the spatial distribution of the wet-get-wetter and dry-get-drier paradigm. Significance Statement This study found that global land precipitation during the dry season slightly increased from 1979 to 2021, while precipitation over oceans declined. Moist static energy analysis showed a trend toward less stability in areas with increased dry season precipitation and the opposite trend in regions with declining precipitation. Water vapor content trends and dynamic components were the primary controlling mechanism for precipitation trends. Furthermore, the hotspots with pronounced increases or decreases in dry season precipitation reflect local circulation changes influenced by anthropogenic or natural factors.},

Combinations of these observation data sets were assimilated into lumped conceptual rainfall-runoff models of the highly-urbanized Don River basin (in southern Ontario) to determine if assimilation of geophysical variables will have a significant impact on simulations and forecasting in an urbanized watershed. The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) data assimilation method was used for these analyses, with various rainfall-runoff models that include GR4J, HyMod, MAC-HBV, and SAC-SMA models. The best data assimilation scheme for hydrologic modeling involved using a combination of streamflow, soil moisture, and snow water equivalent while performing both state and parameter updating. These results suggest that using a combination of soil moisture and snow water equivalent from the SMOS and SNODAS data products can improve simulations and ensemble forecasts in an urban basin.},

This study sought to quantitatively relate temporal changes in the form of Soda Butte Creek, a gravel-bed river in northeastern Yellowstone National Park, to stream power gradients along an 8-km reach. Aerial photographs from 1994 to 2012 and ground-based surveys were used to develop a locational probability map and morphologic sediment budget to assess lateral channel mobility and changes in net sediment flux. A drainage area-to-discharge relationship and DEM developed from LiDAR data were used to obtain the discharge and slope values needed to calculate stream power. Local and lagged relationships between mean stream power gradient at median peak discharge and volumes of erosion, deposition, and net sediment flux were quantified via spatial cross-correlation analyses. Similarly, autocorrelations of locational probabilities and sediment fluxes were used to examine spatial patterns of sediment sources and sinks. Energy expended above critical stream power was calculated for each time period to relate the magnitude and duration of peak flows to the total volumetric change in each time increment. Collectively, we refer to these methods as the stream power gradient (SPG) framework The results of this study were compromised by methodological limitations of the SPG framework and revealed some complications likely to arise when applying this framework to small, wandering, gravel-bed rivers. Correlations between stream power gradients and sediment flux were generally weak, highlighting the inability of relatively simple statistical approaches to link sub-budget cell-scale sediment dynamics to larger-scale driving forces such as stream power gradients. Improving the moderate spatial resolution techniques used in this study and acquiring very-high resolution data from recently developed methods in fluvial remote sensing could help improve understanding of the spatial organization of stream power, sediment transport, and channel change in dynamic natural rivers.

  abstract = {In a hydrological simulation using a complex model, equifinality is likely to occur in many different ways, due to various sources associated with the model structure, parameter as well as data uncertainties involved in modeling process. This study aims to demonstrate the equifinality problem in streamflow prediction with a distributed rainfall-runoff model and also investigate the effect of parameter and input uncertainties on an internal catchment response in time and space under the equifinality condition. For this objective, several experiments were carried out step by step as follows. First, we estimated plausible parameter sets, which lead to similarly good objective function values, using the shuffled complex evolution metropolis (SCEM-UA) algorithm and also generated plausible input scenarios with different spatial patterns from radar rainfall field, which showed minimum runoff errors. Then, we adopted a computational tracer method based on a time-space accounting scheme, combined with a distributed model for analyzing how a catchment behaves under a given equifinality condition by parameter and input uncertainties. It was found that the global responses of a catchment to the predefined equifinality factors were very similar; all simulated hydrographs were almost identical in spite of the different model parameter values and different spatial patterns of rainfall data. On the other hand, the internal catchment responses, tracked by the computational tracer method, were sensitive to plausible scenarios. The results of the internal catchment behavior show that the distributed rainfall-runoff model has multiple alternative flow pathways, providing identical hydrographs in time and space when the rainfall over the catchment transforms into runoff. Our approach can be used to understand catchment responses to various uncertainty sources by visualizing the spatiotemporal runoff generation process at the watershed scale.

  abstract = {Long short-term memory (LSTM) models are recurrent neural networks from the field of deep learning (DL) which have shown promise for time series modelling, especially in conditions when data are abundant. Previous studies have demonstrated the applicability of LSTM-based models for rainfall--runoff modelling; however, LSTMs have not been tested on catchments in Great Britain (GB). Moreover, opportunities exist to use spatial and seasonal patterns in model performances to improve our understanding of hydrological processes and to examine the advantages and disadvantages of LSTM-based models for hydrological simulation. By training two LSTM architectures across a large sample of 669 catchments in GB, we demonstrate that the LSTM and the Entity Aware LSTM (EA LSTM) models simulate discharge with median Nash--Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) scores of 0.88 and 0.86 respectively. We find that the LSTM-based models outperform a suite of benchmark conceptual models, suggesting an opportunity to use additional data to refine conceptual models. In summary, the LSTM-based models show the largest performance improvements in the north-east of Scotland and in south-east of England. The south-east of England remained difficult to model, however, in part due to the inability of the LSTMs configured in this study to learn groundwater processes, human abstractions and complex percolation properties from the hydro-meteorological variables typically employed for hydrological modelling.},

Assessments of future water security depend in part on how the land model components in climate models partition precipitation into evapotranspiration and runoff, and on the sensitivity of this partitioning to climate. Runoff sensitivities are not well constrained, with CMIP5 models displaying a large spread for the present day, which projects onto change under warming, creating uncertainty. Here we show that constraining CMIP5 model runoff sensitivities with observed estimates could reduce uncertainty in runoff projection over the western United States by up to 50\%. We urge caution in the direct use of climate model runoff for applications and encourage model development to use regional-scale hydrological sensitivity metrics to improve projections for water security assessments.},

It is important to know whether Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) is more reliable than CMIP5. Number of studies compared GCMs from two CMIPs in simulating climate variables, but they are not in the field of hydrology for large quantities of watersheds. The objective of this study is to compare CMIP5 and CMIP6 climate model projections in projecting hydrological changes between future (2071-2100) and historical (1976-2005) periods and inter-model variability of hydrological impacts for the future period over 343 catchments in China's mainland. The results show that the GCMs in CMIP6 show more increase in daily mean temperature and mean annual precipitation. However, GCMs in CMIP6 and CMIP5 show similar increases in mean and peak streamflow. Moreover, GCMs in CMIP6 show less inter-model variability for streamflow in southern and northeastern China, but more in central China, which is consistent to that for precipitation after bias correction. Overall, this comparison provides the consistency of future change and uncertainty in predicted streamflow with climate simulations, which bring confidence for hydrological impact studies using CMIP6.},

  abstract = {The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a major mode of interannual climate variability and is expected to affect runoff variations at a global scale. While previous studies focused on the correlation analysis between ENSO and runoff and ENSO-induced amplitude changes of runoff, causal analysis considering the confounding impacts of other major climate modes is lacking. As more extreme ENSO events are projected in the future, it is crucial to enhance our understanding of the impacts of ENSO on global runoff. Here we examine the causal influences of ENSO on runoff over the future period 2015-2100 using outputs from Coupled Modeling Intercomparison Project Phase 6 model simulations. Our analyses account for the possible confounding effects of the Southern Annular Mode, the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole. We find that the signature of ENSO is detectable in future total runoff over various regions including limited areas in central and eastern Asia, large parts of Southeast Asia, limited areas in the eastern and southern Africa, western and eastern Australia, parts of southern and western North America, eastern Antarctica and large parts of South America. There is a high agreement across models for the causal influences of ENSO over central Asia, the eastern coast of Australia, southcentral North America and South America. Multi-model future projections demonstrate higher impacts of ENSO on total runoff over western and central Asia, the western coast of North America and southeastern South America compared to the historical period 1915-2000. All regions with substantial ENSO impacts account for 3.6\% land-area in historical simulation and this fraction increases to 5.6\% in the future scenario. In addition, the results underscore that surface runoff is less sensitive to ENSO compared to total runoff in most regions. These results may have implications for future water management planning based on ENSO.},

We built a theoretical framework based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and performed both binary and count estimations to explore the determinants affecting farmers' adoption of LCTs. Our results indicated that most rice farmers strongly agreed they observed shifting local weather conditions (52.74\% of respondents) and irregular rainfall patterns (52.56\%) within the last year. Further, over twothirds of the respondents perceived that agricultural production contributes to climate variability (26.73\% strongly agreed, and 40.54\% agreed with that statement). In terms of the adoption intensity of LCTs, we found that about 96\% of rice farmers implemented at least one low-carbon technology. Importantly, farmers' perceptions of climate change were positively associated with climate change adaptation. Other significant predictors of climate change adaptation included gender, years of experience, access to agricultural training through extension services, exchange of technical information among farmers, and access to mobile networks and postal services. We underlined policy recommendations that may accelerate climate change adaptation in rice production and complement current agricultural low-carbon programs in China.},

Here the authors quantify past and future terrestrial water-storage changes and find a large net loss in this region, with the Amu Darya and Indus basins as the most vulnerable hotspots. Terrestrial water storage (TWS) over the Tibetan Plateau, a major global water tower, is crucial in determining water transport and availability to a large downstream Asian population. Climate change impacts on historical and future TWS changes, however, are not well quantified. Here we used bottom-up and top-down approaches to quantify a significant TWS decrease (10.2 Gt yr(-1)) over the Tibetan Plateau in recent decades (2002-2017), reflecting competing effects of glacier retreat, lake expansion and subsurface water loss. Despite the weakened trends in projected TWS, it shows large declines under a mid-range carbon emissions scenario by the mid-twenty-first century. Excess water-loss projections for the Amu Darya and Indus basins present a critical water resource threat, indicating declines of 119\% and 79\% in water-supply capacity, respectively. Our study highlights these two hotspots as being at risk from climate change, informing adaptation strategies for these highly vulnerable regions.},

Based on a Eulerian moisture tracking model(WAM-2) and three atmospheric reanalysis products(ERA-I, MERRA-2, and JRA-55), the contributions of moisture sources to the precipitation in six major sub-basins in the TP were tracked during an approximately 35-year period(1979/1980--2015). The results showed that in the upper Indus(UI),upper Tarim River(UT), and Qaidam Basin(QB), the moisture sources mainly extended westward along the mid-latitude westerlies to the western part of the Eurasian continent. In contrast, in the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin(YB), inner TP(ITP), and the source area of three eastern rivers(TER, including the Nujiang River, Lancang River, and Yangtze River), the moisture sources extended both westward and southward, but mainly southward along the ISM. In winter and spring, all of the sub-basins were dominated by western moisture sources. In summer, the western sources migrated northward with the zonal movement of the westerlies, and simultaneously the southern sources of the YB, ITP, and TER expanded largely toward the Indian Ocean along the ISM. In autumn, the moisture sources of the UI, UT, and QB shrank to the western sources, and the moisture sources of the YB, ITP, and TER shrank to the central-southern TP and the Indian subcontinent. By quantifying the moisture contributions from multiple sources, we found that the terrestrial moisture dominated in all of the sub-basins, particularly in the UT and QB(62--73\%). The oceanic contributions were relatively high in the UI(38--42\%) and YB(38--41\%). In winter, evaporation from the large western water bodies(such as the Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf) was significantly higher than that from the continental areas. This contributed to the peak(valley) values of the oceanic(terrestrial) moisture contributions to all of the subbasins. In summer, the terrestrial moisture contributions to the UI, UT, and QB reached their annual maximum, but the abundant oceanic moisture transported by the ISM restrained the appearance of land source contribution peaks in the YB, ITP, and TER,resulting in almost equal moisture contributions in the YB from the ocean and land.},

  abstract = {This study examined the overall performance of the climate models in Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) in simulating the key energy and water fluxes over land. For this purpose, this study selected multiple land flux products as reference data sets and assessed the global spatial means, patterns, trends, seasonal cycles, and regional mean estimates of the sensible heat (SH), latent heat (LH), net radiation (RN), runoff (RF), and precipitation (PR) simulated by 32 CMIP6 models in recent decades. The global (Antarctica, Greenland, and hot deserts are not included) mean SH, LH, RN, RF, and PR simulated by the CMIP6 models are 37.55 +/- 4.81 W m(-2), 49.88 +/- 5.31 W m(-2), 89.10 +/- 4.45 W m(-2), 351.31 +/- 95.28 mm yr(-1), and 948.35 +/- 88.77 mm yr(-1), respectively. The ensemble median of CMIP6 simulations (CMIP6-MED) can provide robust estimates of global and regional land fluxes, which are within the ranges given by the reference data sets, and highly consistent spatiotemporal patterns of these fluxes. The comparison of CMIP6-MED with the first preferred reference data sets shows that CMIP6-MED generally overestimates the water and energy fluxes over land, except for the simulated RF and PR in the Amazon region. The most disagreements between CMIP6-MED and the reference data sets occur in South America (particularly the Amazon region) and the Tibetan Plateau. Finally, the sources of model biases are discussed. It is suggested that current land flux products should be widely used to optimize the structures and parameters of climate models in future work.},

  abstract = {Precipitation simulation and projection in global climate models (GCMs) play an important role in regional water resource management. Since multiple climate simulations from CMIP6 are already available, we evaluated the precipitation performance over the Yangtze River basin (YRB) from 18 models against observations during 1961-2014, before using the relevant simulations for scientific investigation and policy making. Our results suggest that CMIP6 models generally capture the increasing pattern of precipitation from the source region to the lower reaches of the YRB. However, most models overestimate precipitation (wet bias), by about 28.6\% for multi-model ensemble mean (MEM). Spatially, the most significant wet bias could reach 70.1\% in the source region. Seasonally, the wet bias is more pronounced in the cold season (56.2\% in winter and 45.1\% in spring). For precipitation change during 1961-2014, most models reproduce the observed increasing trend in the most northwest YRB, but they display large spatial discrepancies in the other regions. In CMIP6 projections (2015-2099), the precipitation over the YRB keep a consistently increasing trend under both scenarios SSP1-2.6 (14.76 mm/10a) and SSP5-8.5 (22.47 mm/10a). From near term (2015-2060) to long term (2061-2099), this wetting trend slows down under SSP1-2.6, but it accelerates under SSP5-8.5.},

  abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is sensitive to climate change in the land-atmosphere coupling mechanism due to its complex topographic features and unique geographic location. This study explored the teleconnection between pre-summer thawing of frozen soil over the TP and summer precipitation in East Asia in the Meiyu-Baiu rainy season (June, July) from 1981 to 2019 using maximum covariance analysis (MCA). The precipitation fields forced by thawing of frozen soil were calculated by the coupled manifold technique. The variations in East Asian precipitation are significantly impacted by thawing of frozen soil over the TP, with a variance explained ratio in the surrounding middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River (MLYR) of around 10\%-20\%. The MCA analysis also revealed that the thickness of pre-summer frozen soil thawing had a positive relationship with summer precipitation in the MLYR and southern Japan (fraction = 0.59, correlation approximate to 0.99). To find out the possible mechanism, composite analyses were conducted on atmospheric and surface components with reanalysis products. The analysis results suggested that more (less) frozen soil thawing would increase (decrease) the sensible heat and land surface temperature with enhanced (weakened) surface diabatic heating over the TP. Then, the positive (negative) surface diabatic heating would result in an enhanced (weakened) South Asia High extending eastward followed by stronger (weaker) upper troposphere (200 hPa) westerlies, as well as the West North Pacific Subtropical High extending westward. As a result, the northeastward movement of the integrated vapor transport intensified (weakened) with the westward extension (eastward retreat) of the Meiyu-Baiu rain belt, leading to more (less) precipitation in the MLYR and southern Japan. It is thus suggested that pre-summer thawing of frozen soil over the TP could play a vital role in regulating East Asian summer precipitation and movement of the Meiyu-Baiu rain belt.},

  abstract = {During the DACCIWA (Dynamics--Aerosol--Chemistry--Cloud Interactions in West Africa) field campaign {$\sim$}900 radiosondes were launched from 12 stations in southern West Africa from 15 June to 31 July 2016. Subsequently, data-denial experiments were conducted using the Integrated Forecasting System of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) to assess the radiosondes' impact on the quality of analyses and forecasts. As observational reference, satellite-based estimates of rainfall and outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) as well as the radiosonde measurements themselves are used. With regard to the analyses, the additional observations show positive impacts on winds throughout the troposphere and lower stratosphere, while large lower-tropospheric cold and dry biases are hardly reduced. Nonetheless, downstream, that is farther inland from the radiosonde stations, we find a significant increase (decrease) in low-level night-time temperatures (monsoon winds) when incorporating the DACCIWA observations, suggesting a possible linkage via weaker cold air advection from the Gulf of Guinea. The associated lower relative humidity leads to reduced cloud cover in the DACCIWA analysis. Closer to the coast and over Benin and Togo, DACCIWA observations increase low-level specific humidity and precipitable water, possibly due to changes in advection and vertical mixing. During daytime, differences between the two analyses are generally smaller at low levels. With regard to the forecasts, the impact of the additional observations is lost after a day or less. Moderate improvements occur in low-level wind and temperature but also in rainfall over the downstream Sahel, while impacts on OLR are ambiguous. The changes in precipitation appear to also affect high-level cloud cover and the tropical easterly jet. The overall rather small observation impact suggests that model and data assimilation deficits are the main limiting factors for better forecasts in West Africa. The new observations and physical understanding from DACCIWA can hopefully contribute to reducing these issues.},

  abstract = {Spatiotemporally continuous global river discharge estimates across the full spectrum of stream orders are vital to a range of hydrologic applications, yet they remain poorly constrained. Here we present a carefully designed modeling effort (Variable Infiltration Capacity land surface model and Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge river routing model) to estimate global river discharge at very high resolutions. The precipitation forcing is from a recently published 0.1{$^\circ$} global product that optimally merged gauge-, reanalysis-, and satellite-based data. To constrain runoff simulations, we use a set of machine learning-derived, global runoff characteristics maps (i.e., runoff at various exceedance probability percentiles) for grid-by-grid model calibration and bias correction. To support spaceborne discharge studies, the river flowlines are defined at their true geometry and location as much as possible ---approximately 2.94 million vector flowlines (median length 6.8 km) and unit catchments are derived from a high-accuracy global digital elevation model at 3-arcsec resolution ({\textasciitilde}90 m), which serves as the underlying hydrography for river routing. Our 35-year daily and monthly model simulations are evaluated against over 14,000 gauges globally. Among them, 35\% (64\%) have a percentage bias within {\textpm}20\% ({\textpm}50\%), and 29\% (62\%) have a monthly Kling-Gupta Efficiency {$\geq$}0.6 (0.2), showing data robustness at the scale the model is assessed. This reconstructed discharge record can be used as a priori information for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission's discharge product, thus named ``Global Reach-level A priori Discharge Estimates for Surface Water and Ocean Topography''. It can also be used in other hydrologic applications requiring spatially explicit estimates of global river flows.},

This study proposes two pathways of bias-correction with deep learning (DL) models incorporated. One is the deterministic pathway (DP), in which the bias correction is directly applied to the precipitation forecasts. The other one, namely the probability pathway (PP), corrects the forecasted precipitation anomalies using a conditional probability method before being added to the observational climatology. These two pathways have been applied to correct the precipitation forecasts based on a GCM prediction system Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology Climate Forecast System version 1.0 (NUIST-CFS1.0). The applications of DL models in the both pathways yield higher resolution of corrected predictions than the uncorrected ones. Both pathways improve summer precipitation predictions at 4-month lead. Moreover, the DP correction shows a better performance in predicting extreme precipitation, while the PP is proficient in correcting the spatial pattern of precipitation anomalies over China. The present results highlight the importance of the application of appropriate correction strategy for different prediction purposes.},

  abstract = {Accelerating multiphase water transformation affects runoff processes and components greatly and have changed the spatiotemporal patterns of water resources in the Third Polar Region. The source region of the Yangtze River is one location where accelerated warming has resulted in the gradual extension of the ablation period since 1990. This has caused the acceleration of multiphase water transformation, characterized by increases in the rate of glacial retreat, maximum freezing depth, and annual actual evapotranspiration and by decreased snowfall. In response, the total runoff increased by 53\% at the Tuotuohe national hydrological station (TTH) and 6\% at the Zhimenda national hydrological station (ZMD) during the periods 1961--1990 and 1991--2017, respectively. Under these conditions, runoff components were being determined based on stable isotope tracing. Substantial seasonal differences in {$\delta$}18O ({$\delta$}D) among precipitation, river water, supra-permafrost water, and glaciers snow meltwater indicate that the runoff has been replenished by multiple components, and that these first infiltrate the ground, becoming part of the groundwater, and then recharge river water. Supra-permafrost water rather than precipitation now dominates river water. Based on the end-member mixing analysis model, supra-permafrost water, precipitation, and glaciers snow meltwater accounted for 51\%, 26\%, and 23\% of river water at the TTH station from June 2016 to May 2018; the corresponding values at the ZMD station were 49\%, 34\%, and 17\%. Additionally, there are also differences in the seasonal contributions of runoff components to river water. Seasonal variations in the freezing and thawing of the active layer directly trigger the runoff process. Future research should be focused on determining the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of precipitation-supra-permafrost water-runoff, which will aid the assessment of the impacts of an unstable Asian Water Tower on water resources.},

  abstract = {The source area of the Yellow River (SAYR) is one of the world ' s largest wetlands containing the greatest diversity of high altitude marshlands. For this reason, its response to climate change is extremely significant. As revealed by different studies, the response of hydrological processes to global warming results in high uncertainties and complexities in the water cycle of the SAYR. Thus, understanding and projecting future runoff changes in this region has become increasingly important. In the present investigation, we used runoff and meteorological data of the SAYR from 1976 to 2014 (historical period). In addition, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), land-use, and soil data for the period 1976 to 2100 were used considering three future SSPs (Shared Socioeconomic Paths) scenarios of 8 models selected from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to simulate, project, and analyze potential variations and future runoff of the main hydrological stations (Jimai, Maqu, and Tangnaihai) located in the SAYR. The results showed that: 1) The SWAT model displayed good applicability in historical runoff simulation in the SAYR. A small runoff simulation uncertainty was observed as the simulated value was close to the measured value. 2) Under three different 2021-2100 SSPs scenarios, the yearly discharge of the three hydrological stations located in the SAYR showed an increasing trend with respect to the historical period. Future runoff is mainly affected by precipitation. 3) We compared the 1976-2014 average annual runoff with projected values for the periods 2021-2060 and 2061-2100. With respect to 2021-2060, the lowest and highest increases occurred at Tangnaihai and Maqu Stations in the emission scenarios without (SSP585) and with mitigation (SSP126), respectively. However, the highest and lowest increments at Jimai Station were observed in the intermediate emission (SSP245) and SSP126 scenarios, respectively. Moreover, in 2061-2100, the Maqu and Tangnaihai Stations showed the lowest and highest increments in the SSP585 and SSP245 scenarios, correspondingly. In Jimai Station, the lowest increment occurred in SSP126. The yearly average discharge in the near future will be smaller than that in the far future. Overall, this study provides scientific understanding of future hydrological responses to climate changes in the alpine area. This information can also be of help in the selection of actions for macro-control, planning, and management of water resources, and the protection of wetlands in the SAYR.},

  abstract = {The runoff in Tibetan Plateau (TP) is sensitive to environmental changes, and it is thus challenging to assess the variations and influencing factors of runoff in the context of global warming and increased human activities. We addressed this challenge by using the most comprehensive dataset, Budyko hypothesis, and wavelet theory to attribute runoff variations in the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin (YZRB), and its interaction with regional environmental variables (e.g., precipitation PCP, relative humidity RH, average temperature TMPave, maximum temperature TMPmax, minimum temperature TMPmin, wind speed WS, snow depth SD, potential evapotranspiration ET0, and normalized difference vegetation index NDVI). The results indicated that, 1) the warming of the YZRB was 0.47, 0.36, and 0.65~{$^\circ$}C/decade in TMPave, TMPmax, and TMPmin, two to three times the global mean rate, and the increasing trend of precipitation was nonsignificant; 2) ET0 increased significantly by 2.25~mm/decade, and SD decreased rapidly at a rate of 2.54~mm/decade. 3) The streamflow (lower Nuxia) showed a decreasing trend from 1960 to 2015, primarily caused by climate change, which accounted for 78.81\%. Human activities contributed 21.19\%; 4) Seasonal streamflow increased in Spring and Winter and declined in Summer and Autumn. 5) PCP was the single variable mostly associated with runoff. When PCP-SD and PCP-RH-ET0 were combined, they demonstrated the most robust relationships with runoff, respectively; 6) A modest increase in PCP and accelerating snowmelt may not offset water dissipation due to severe warming. Further research is necessary to improve understanding of the driving mechanisms behind seasonal and inter-annual variability in the runoff and to provide strategies for mitigation and adaptation to environmental change.},

  abstract = {The Taoer River, a representative ecologically sensitive area in Northeast China, has undergone great climate changes and rapid social developments since 1961. Subsequently, a substantial alteration of the streamflow regime was observed and severe eco-environmental problems were becoming prominent. To provide decision makers the scientific basis for effective resource management and sound future planning, it is crucial to understand and assess the impacts of the climate variability and human activities on streamflow in this region. In this study, we combined an observation-based statistical analysis and physical modeling experiments to address this broad question. The Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope were used to examine the trends and the moving t test was used to identify change points for the streamflow, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration datasets. A statistically significant upward trend (alpha = 5 \%) was found for annual streamflow. An abrupt change point was identified in 1985 for the basin outlet station at Taonan. Accordingly, the streamflow was divided into baseline and changed period for attribution analysis. To investigate the impacts of climate change and human activities on annual streamflow, we applied a distributed hydrological model and six Budyko-type functions during the two periods. The results indicated that climate change and human activities accounted for about 45 and 55 \% of the changes in streamflow, respectively.},

  abstract = {Long-term land surface temperature (LST) variation is vital for the study of climate change and environmental monitoring. Change detection methods provide access to recovery trajectories of trend and seasonality and detect abrupt changes in LST time series, but a comprehensive evaluation of the published methods is lacking. In this study, simulated LST data with a temporal resolution of 8~days under different scenarios were used to evaluate the performance of three commonly used methods: Detecting Breakpoints and Estimating Segments in Trend (DBEST), Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST), and Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonal change, and Trend (BEAST). The results obtained using the simulated data indicated that BEAST was the best method for decomposing LST time series into trend and seasonality (mean RMSEs were 0.28~K and 0.27~K, respectively) and for detecting abrupt changes in these two components (mean F1 scores were 0.83 and 0.95, respectively). BFAST was less robust to high-complexity data (F1: 0.56 and 0.52, RMSE: 1.34~K and 1.46~K). 0.91~K and 1.29~K). DBEST is recommended to capture component details because it yields the least generalized output (F1 for trend: 0.37, RMSE: 0.64~K and 1.37~K). Both BFAST and DBEST exhibited reduced accuracy when the time-series data has long-lasting continuous missing data. An application using the 20-year MODIS LST time series supports the results obtained using the simulated data. BEAST exhibited the highest detection accuracy for land cover change (13 correct detections among 15 true changes), followed by DBEST (9) and BFAST (7). All three methods were ineffective for detecting low-magnitude disturbances: wildfires, heatwaves, and cold spells due to their low intensity or short duration. To reduce the non-negligible commission error of BEAST, this study proposes an improved BEAST, which eliminates the false breakpoints in BEAST using a set of thresholds. Compared with BEAST, the user accuracy of the improved BEAST was significantly increased by 13.9\% in the simulated data, resulting in an F1 increase of 0.04, and 15 false breakpoints were eliminated among 53 detected disturbances in the MODIS LST time series. This study outlines commonly used change detection methods and offers guidance for choosing the optimal method to detect changes in LST time series. Furthermore, suggestions on the determination of parameters and false breakpoints elimination in the improved BEAST enable it more practical.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the contributions of climate change and human activities on runoff changes is of great importance for water resource management, sustainable water resource utilization, and sustainable development of society. In this study, hydrological and climatic data from hydrological and meteorological stations in the headwaters of the Yangtze River (YRHA) from 1966 to 2013 were used to quantitatively attribute the runoff change to the impacts of climate change and human activities separately. Firstly, the change trends in precipitation, runoff depth and potential evapotranspiration were analyzed by the Mann-Kendall test method. Three methods, secondly, including ordered clustering, Mann-Kendall and cumulative anomaly curve were adopted to detect the change points of runoff at Zhimenda hydrological station and partition the whole study period into two sub-periods at the change point (base and impacted periods). Then, the elasticity coefficient method based on the Budyko hypothesis was applied to calculate elasticity coefficients of runoff to precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and land use/cover during the two periods, and to evaluate the contributions of climate change and human activities. Results indicated that during 1966-2013, runoff depth, precipitation and potential evapotranspiration all showed a significant increasing trend, with increasing rates of 7.26 mm decade 1, 18.725 mm decade 1 and 7.228 mm decade 1, respectively. One change point (2004) was detected for the annual runoff, and 1966-2003 and 2004-2013 were respectively identified as base and impacted periods. The results of elasticity coefficients showed that the runoff depth was most sensitive to the change of precipitation during the two periods. The relative contributions of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and parameter n to runoff changes were 99.7\%, 6.08\% and 3.88\%, respectively. Furthermore, the coupled contribution rate of other factors was less than 2.5\%. Generally, results indicated that precipitation is the main factor on the historical runoff changes in this basin.},

  abstract = {Differentiating and clarifying the driving factors behind streamflow changes are critical for highlighting hydrological responses to changing environments. However, due to the limited number of hydrological stations, the dominant factor controlling global observed streamflow change remains unclear and intensely debated. Here, we revisit this scientific issue by using the most comprehensive dataset to attribute the observed global streamflow changes during 1960-2014. The results suggest that other factors than precipitation (P) and potential evaporation (E-0) are the most important contributors to global observed streamflow changes, which dominate streamflow change for 48.9-50.9\% of the stations. In contrast, the dominant factor translated into P in 72.3-72.9\% of stations when using reconstructed streamflow datasets, in agreement with most previous global assessments. These differences indicate that streamflow attributions using reconstructed streamflow might overestimate the effects of P while underestimating the roles of other factors, such as the vegetation and human impact. At the global scale, the other factors affected by many catchment characteristics and their impacts on streamflow change have remarkable regional differences. This study highlights the necessity to apply the observed data in streamflow attribution to avoid biased conclusions re-garding the dominant factor of streamflow changes. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Pan Third Pole (PTP) region includes Tibet Plateau (TP), Central Asia (CA) and Southeast Asia (SEA) and it is one of the places on earth that are most sensitive to climate change. Meanwhile, PTP origins a series of large rivers such as Yangtze River, Yellow River and Lancang-Mekong River, which feed millions of people downstream. Therefore, climate change in PTP has significant impact on livings and water supply of local residents. In this study, 16 model predictions from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and Climate Research Unit (CRU) observations are used to evaluate historical precipitation and temperature climatology changes in PTP region for the far (1901-1930), middle (1941-1970) and near history (1981-2010) respectively. In addition, Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach is applied to obtain the multi-model weighted average prediction and the BMA values are further used to assess the climate variabilities in the near (2021-2050), middle (2046-2075) and far future (2071-2100) under four SSP-RCP scenarios. Results indicate that temperature is significantly underestimated by most CMIP6 models in TP especially IPSL-CM6A-LR and CanESM5 whereas precipitation is overestimated for CA and TP. Most CMIP6 models do not predict precipitation very well in SEA, the difference of annual total precipitation between the highest estimation from UKESM1-0-LL and the lowest estimation from CAMS-CSM1-0 is about 800 mm. Overall, BMA prediction is more reliable compared with individual models. In addition, Pan Third Pole region is projected to be warmer and wetter in the future and the trend is stronger under SSP5-8.5 scenario. The BMA predicted temperature uncertainty is larger for high latitude CA region whereas precipitation uncertainty is higher for low latitude SEA region.},

  abstract = {Climate and vegetation changes are main factors influencing water partitioning. However, their impacts on water partitioning are still not well understood. To revisit the interactions among climate, vegetation and water partitioning, this study introduces the climate seasonality (CS) and vegetation seasonality (VS) into the Budyko framework, by using a statistical approach combining the three-parameter Log-logistic probability distribution and multiple linear regression, based on the monthly P -ET0 (precipitation (P) minus potential evapotranspiration (ET0)) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This method is then validated and applied in 86 global catchments to quantify the contribution of climate and vegetation changes to evapotranspiration (ET). Results show that this model can predict well (mean R-2 = 0.81 +/- 0.05, P {$<$} 0.05) the parameter n, a parameter reflecting the interactions between land surface and atmosphere in the Budyko framework. More importantly, CS and VS jointly control the variation in parameter n, and in average jointly contribute more (mean relative contribution of 57.1 +/- 2.3 \%) than the changes in P and ET0 (mean of 42.9 +/- 2.3\%) to ET. These indicate that CS and VS are at least as important as the changes in P and ET0 in affecting water balance. Furthermore, the VS contributes slightly lower (mean of 24.9 +/- 0.3\%) than the CS does (mean of 32.2 +/- 2.3\%), implying that CS and VS play comparable roles in water partitioning. These findings would be valuable for water resources management and assessing the impacts of climate and land surface changes on water balance in a gradually changing environment.},

  abstract = {Adequate knowledge of climatic change over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) with an average elevation of more than 4000 m above sea level (a.s.1.) has been insufficient for a long time owing to the lack of sufficient observational data. In the present study, monthly surface air temperature data were collected from almost every meteorological station on the TP since their establishment. There are 97 stations located above 2000 m a.s.1. on the TP; the longest records at five stations began before the 1930s, but most records date from the mid-1950s. Analyses of the temperature series show that the main portion of the TP has experienced statistically significant warming since the mid-1950s, especially in winter, but the recent warming in the central and eastern TP did not reach the level of the 1940s warm period until the late 1990s. Compared with the Northern Hemisphere and the global average, the warming of the TP occurred early. The linear rates of temperature increase over the TP during the period 1955-1996 are about 0.16 degreesC/decade for the annual mean and 0.32 degreesC/decade for the winter mean, which exceed those for the Northern Hemisphere and the same latitudinal zone in the same period. Furthermore, there is also a tendency for the warming trend to increase with the elevation in the TP and its surrounding areas. This suggests that the TP is one of the most sensitive areas to respond to global climate change. Copyright (C) 2000 Royal Meteorological Society.},

Particular importance was attached to human activities, such as population density and Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and also water reservoirs in terms of their relationship with streamflow changes. Results indicated that: (1) streamflow changes of river basins in northern China were more sensitive to climate change than those of river basins in southern China. Based on the degree of sensitivity, the influencing factors to which streamflow changes are sensitive included: precipitation {$>$} human activities {$>$} relative humidity {$>$} solar radiation {$>$} maximum temperature {$>$} wind speed {$>$} minimum temperature. Hence, it can be argued that hydrological systems in northern China are more fragile and more sensitive to changing environment than those in southern China and hence water resources management in northern China is more challenging; (2) during 1980-2000, climate change tended to increase stream flow changes across China and have a dominant role in streamflow variation. However, climate change tends to decrease streamflow in river basins of northern China. Generally, human activities cause a decrease of streamflow across China; (3) In recent years such as a period of 2001-2014, human activities tend to have increasing or enhancing impacts on instream flow changes, and fractional contributions of climate change and human activities to streamflow changes are, respectively, 53.5\% and 46.5\%. Increasing human-induced impacts on streamflow changes have the potential to add more uncertainty in the management of water resources at different spatial and temporal scales. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Expansion of a detailed hydrological modelling from catchment- to national- or continental-scale is of important theoretical and practical significance, yet faces many challenges. We developed a high-resolution, physically-based hydrological model named WEP-CN (Water and Energy transfer Processes in China) for China. Different climatic and hydrological conditions and geological structures as well as their impact on infiltration and runoff were examined and incorporated in WEP-CN. The study area (9.6 million km2) was divided into 19,406 sub-watersheds and 81,687 contour belts. The computation units, model input, and model structure and parameters in WEP-CN were improved to obtain a well-defined simulation area, a more reliable input as well as a detailed description of soil moisture movement in several special vadose zones such as karst development, swelling and frozen soil. Continuous simulations of various natural hydrological processes were conducted for 62~years from 1956 to 2017. We demonstrated the efficacy of our model by comparing simulated and statistical monthly streamflow at 203 hydrological stations across the country. For the validation period of 1981--2000, the Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) was found to be larger than 0.7 at 80\% of the stations, and the absolute value of relative error (RE) was less than 10\% at 95\% of the stations. Our result highlights the benefit of incorporating new mechanisms on the special vadose zone water movement and accounts for the impact of elevation change on meteorological and vegetation variables. This paper can serve as a reference for large-scale hydrological simulation with diverse climate, topography and underlying surface conditions.},

Here, we present a new framework to quantify the driving factors behind Rv globally by decomposing Rv into the temporal variance of precipitation (P), potential evapotranspiration (E0), total water storage change (∆S), and other factors (represented by n in Budyko equation), such as climate seasonality, land cover, and human impact, at intra-annual, interannual, and multiannual timescales. The results reveal that P controls Rv at different timescales in most parts of the globe. P has distinctly larger impacts on Rv in humid basins at the multiannual scale, while other factors have larger impacts in arid basins. We highlight the different impacts of driving factors on Rv at multiple timescales, which contradicts previous global assessments that assess the relative importance by sensitivity.},

To reflect the mismatch between water supply (precipitation, P) and energy (potential evapotranspiration, E0), we proposed a climate seasonality and asynchrony index (SAI) in terms of both phase and amplitude mismatch between P and E0. Considering streamflow changes in 26 large river basins as a case study, SAI was found to the key factor explaining 51\&thinsp;\% of the annual variance of parameter n. Furthermore, the vegetation dynamics (M) remarkably impacted the temporal variation in n, explaining 67\&thinsp;\% of the variance. With SAI and M, a semi-empirical formula for parameter n was developed at the annual scale to describe annual runoff (R) and evapotranspiration (E). The impacts of climate variability (Pe, E0 and SAI) and M on R and E changes were then quantified. Results showed that R and E changes were controlled mainly by the Pe variations in most river basins over the globe, while SAI acted as the controlling factor modifying R and E changes in the East Asian subtropical monsoon zone. SAI, M and E0 have larger impacts on E than on R, whereas Pe has larger impacts on R.},

  abstract = {Understanding the effects of climate and catchment characteristics on hydrological behavior is critical in hydrological sciences. Furthermore, improving the clarity associated with the physical meaning of the Budyko hypothesis on how it can be incorporated into ecohydrological processes remains a significant challenge, while the conciseness it affords in addressing hydrological responses has promoted its application. This study explores the hydrological effects of the snow fraction (fs) and assesses the ecohydrological meaning of the catchment parameter (n) within the Budyko framework, employing 1576 globally investigated catchments. Results showed that the Budyko hypothesis decreased systematic errors (NS = 0.76, RMSE = 181.01 mm a-1) when incorporating the fs compared with no snow fraction incorporated it (NS = 0.54, RMSE = 248.85 mm a-1), especially for catchments with higher fs. In these catchments, a higher fs was generally consistent with a higher normalized mean streamflow (Q), while the opposite was true for normalized evaporation (E/P). Under the Budyko framework, n and fs distribution generally exhibited opposite trends. Moreover, higher n was mainly distributed near water limited and the highest energy limited boundaries, while higher fs represented lower (P-Q)/P (i.e., the mean (P-Q)/P was 0.59, 0.57, and 0.38 for catchments with lower (fs {$<$} 0.15), medium (0.15 {$<$}= fs {$<$} 0.50), and higher (fs {$>$}= 0.50) fs). Statistical relationships among ecohydrological processes and catchment parameter suggested that: (i) higher storm depth (alpha) generally indicated higher normalized mean Q; (ii) a higher plant-available water holding capacity (kappa) resulted in a reduction in Q/P, especially when kappa was {$>$} 0.12; (iii) the effective rooting depth (Ze) exhibited a complex regulatory effect on P partitioning; and (iv) alpha, Ze, and kappa controlled n by 65\%, 22\%, and 13\%, respectively, in all catchments. The ecohydrological processes incorporated into catchment parameters will broaden the ability of the Budyko hypothesis to describe hydrological behavior in a changing world, especially in the ungauged catchment.},

  abstract = {Observed rainfall and flow data from the Dongjiang River basin in humid southern China were used to investigate runoff changes during low-flow and flooding periods and in annual flows over the past 45 years. We first applied the non-parametric Mann-Kendall rank statistic method to analyze the change trend in precipitation, surface runoff and pan evaporation in those three periods. Findings showed that only the surface runoff in the low-flow period increased significantly, which was due to a combination of increased precipitation and decreased pan evaporation. The Pettitt-Mann-Whitney statistical test results showed that 1973 and 1978 were the change points for the low-flow period runoff in the Boluo sub-catchment and in the Qilinzui sub-catchment, respectively. Most importantly, we have developed a framework to separate the effects of climate change and human activities on the changes in surface runoff based on the back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) method from this research. Analyses from this study indicated that climate variabilities such as changes in precipitation and evaporation, and human activities such as reservoir operations, each accounted for about 50\% of the runoff change in the low-flow period in the study basin.

However, quantitative assessments of these impacts are lacking on large scales. In this study, we use the simulations from six global hydrological models driven by three meteorological forcings to investigate direct human impact (DHI) and climate impact on streamflow in China. Results show that, in the sub-periods of 1971-1990 and 1991-2010, one-fifth to one-third of mean annual streamflow (MAF) was reduced due to DHI in northern basins, and much smaller ({$<$} 4 \%) MAF was reduced in southern basins. From 1971-1990 to 1991-2010, total MAF changes range from 13\% to 10\% across basins wherein the relative contributions of DHI change and climate variability show distinct spatial patterns. DHI change caused decreases in MAF in 70\% of river segments, but climate variability dominated the total MAF changes in 88\% of river segments of China. In most northern basins, climate variability results in changes of -9\% to 18\% in MAF, while DHI change results in decreases of 2\% to 8\% in MAF. In contrast with the climate variability that may increase or decrease streamflow, DHI change almost always contributes to decreases in MAF over time, with water withdrawals supposedly being the major impact on streamflow. This quantitative assessment can be a reference for attribution of streamflow changes at large scales, despite remaining uncertainty. We highlight the significant DHI in northern basins and the necessity to modulate DHI through improved water management towards a better adaptation to future climate change.},

However, the effects of increasing vegetation greenness particularly afforestation on the hydrological cycle have been controversial. We used a process-based ecosystem model and a satellite-derived leaf area index (LAI) dataset to examine how the changes in vegetation greenness affected annual evapotranspiration (ET) and water yield for China over the period from 2000 to 2014. Significant trends in vegetation greenness were observed in 26.1\% of China's land area. We used two model simulations driven with original and detrended LAI, respectively, to assess the effects of vegetation 'greening' and 'browning' on terrestrial ET and water yield. Ona per-pixel basis, vegetation greening increased annual ET and decreased water yield, while vegetation browning reduced ET and increased water yield. At the large river basin and national scales, the greening trends also had positive effects on annual ET and had negative effects on water yield. Our results showed that the effects of the changes in vegetation greenness on the hydrological cycle varied with spatial scale. Afforestation efforts perhaps should focus on southern China with larger water supply given the water crisis in northern China and the negative effects of vegetation greening on water yield. Future studies on the effects of the greenness changes on the hydrological cycle are needed to account for the feedbacks to the climate.},

Here we applied an optimal fingerprint method to detect and attribute ET change by integrated utilization of state-of-the-art global ecosystem models and GCMs. Results indicate that CLI provides the greatest contribution to increasing ET, and its fingerprint is detectable at different timescales. CO2 reduces ET in most areas covered by forests. LUC decreases ET over the tropics, while increases ET over temperate and high-latitude regions. To further subdivide the impacts of CLI, we extend the Budyko framework to quantify the contribution of precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) and find that the dominant role of CLI mainly depends on the contribution of P.},

  abstract = {Data analysis based on station observations reveals that many meteorological variables averaged over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are closely correlated, and their trends during the past decades are well correlated with the rainfall trend of the Asian summer monsoon. However, such correlation does not necessarily imply causality. Further diagnosis confirms the existence of a weakening trend in TP thermal forcing, characterized by weakened surface sensible heat flux in spring and summer during the past decades. This weakening trend is associated with decreasing summer precipitation over northern South Asia and North China and increasing precipitation over northwestern China, South China, and Korea. An atmospheric general circulation model, the HadAM3, is employed to elucidate the causality between the weakening TP forcing and the change in the Asian summer monsoon rainfall. Results demonstrate that a weakening in surface sensible heating over the TP results in reduced summer precipitation in the plateau region and a reduction in the associated latent heat release in summer. These changes in turn result in the weakening of the near-surface cyclonic circulation surrounding the plateau and the subtropical anticyclone over the subtropical western North Pacific, similar to the results obtained from the idealized TP experiment in Part I of this study. The southerly that normally dominates East Asia, ranging from the South China Sea to North China, weakens, resulting in a weaker equilibrated Sverdrup balance between positive vorticity generation and latent heat release. Consequently, the convergence of water vapor transport is confined to South China, forming a unique anomaly pattern in monsoon rainfall, the so-called "south wet and north dry." Because the weakening trend in TP thermal forcing is associated with global warming, the present results provide an effective means for assessing projections of regional climate over Asia in the context of global warming.},

Systematically investigating the underlying influence of catchment characteristics on n is critical for understanding the partitioning of P. Using two runoff datasets with more than 30,000 stations around the world, we found that the variability in n was significantly correlated with a series of catchment characteristics, but varied across climate zones. Hence, several empirical models based on catchment characteristics were developed to estimate n for different climate zones. The developed empirical models applied to Budyko framework explained 92\% of the spatial variability in the global mean R and provided more reasonable ET than that from Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) in terms of long-term water and energy balances. Empirical models were further applied to predict and attribute future R under the high-end Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP5-8.5). The changes in P, potential evaporation (PET), and n are projected to alter global R by 61.5\%, -24.0\%, and 14.5\% during 2081-2100. Notably, compare with the historical period, the influence of n was reversed in arid zones under the future scenario, where n leads to a significant decrease in R. The developed empirical models n enhances the applicability and capability of the Budyko framework for both historical and future hydrological assessments over the globe.},

  abstract = {An increase in climate change has been leading to non-stationarity in hydrological variables. Therefore, a simple framework within the Budyko hypothesis is proposed to estimate the annual runoff frequency distribution and provide a new method for practical application in hydrological design under the non-stationarity. In this framework, the annual runoff statistic parameters, mean value (MAR) and standard deviation (STD), are derived by the Choudhury-Yang equation; at the same time, a magnification factor {$\gamma$}1~=~1.358 is introduced to correct the underestimation of the Budyko-based estimated STD according to observation data in 291 catchments across China. Furthermore, the P-{\cyrchar\CYRSH} type frequency curve is selected to calculate the annual runoff on a specific design return period. Here, the impacts of non-stationarity caused by climate change was considered to be encoded in the changes in statistic parameters and frequency distribution. Based on this framework, the changes in water resources in 207 three-level basins across China during 2020--2050 are given. The results show that the average MAR will decrease by 2.7\% for all basins, and the spatial distribution of MAR will be more even, i.e., it will increase in the north of China and decrease in the south of China. However, the inter-annual variability of annual runoff (shown as STD and variance coefficient, Cv) will increase in more than 70\% of basins. Additionally, in the dry year, about 65\% of basins show decreased runoff change, which indicates a larger reservoir capacity is need for water resource allocation. These findings offer a simple and effective way to re-examine the effects of non-stationarity on projected annual runoff.},

  abstract = {Climate change intensification can induce unprecedented alterations to global hydrological cycling. This study employed the Budyko framework to assess water balance shifts induced by resultant multiyear drought events, selecting 1,258 among 3,347 globally distributed catchments. Here, the precipitation (P) deficit was used to identify long-term drought, while the Budyko framework was used to explore the impact of long-term drought on changes in streamflow (Q). Additionally, this study developed a novel method (the trigonometric function decomposition method (TFD method)) to analyze Q change induced by climate and catchment properties changes. Results showed that: (a) long-term drought has caused catchment property parameter (n) increase (i.e., n is 2.14 and 2.33 during non-drought period and drought period in 1,258 catchments, respectively), which will alter P partitioning into E and Q; (b) sensitivity analysis presented n is most sensitive to changes in aridity index, while effective rooting depth (Ze) contributed larger magnitude in variability of n; (c) a reduction in the magnitude of Q decreased under a reduction in climatic aridity, which were primarily controlled by climate changes (average value, 80.83\%), while asymmetrical effects of Q reduction were induced by catchment property changes and suggested Q reduction were weakened in arid and humid regions, while strengthened in semi-arid and sub-humid regions. Together, these factors all indicated that multiyear drought events can significantly alter Q, while the hydrological response to drought events was characterized by complex mechanisms. Clarifying the hydrological response to multiyear drought events will help us better understand how climate change affects water resources.},

  abstract = {Budyko's framework has been widely used to study basin-scale water and energy balances and one of the formulations of the Budyko curve is Fu's equation. The curve shape parameter (sic) in Fu's equation controls how much of the available water will be evaporated given the available energy. Previous studies have found that land surface characteristics significantly affect variations in the parameter (sic). In this study, we focus on the vegetation impact and examine the conditions under which vegetation plays a major role in controlling the variability of (sic). Using data from 26 major global river basins that are larger than 300,000 km(2), the basin-specific (sic) parameter is found to be linearly correlated with the long-term averaged annual vegetation coverage. A simple parameterization for the (sic) parameter based solely on remotely sensed vegetation information is proposed, which improves predictions of annual actual evapotranspiration by reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) from 76 mm to 47 mm as compared to the default (sic) value used in the Budyko curve method. The controlling impact of vegetation on the basin-specific (sic) parameter is diminished in small catchments with areas less than 50,000 km(2), which suggests a scale-dependence of the role of vegetation in affecting water and energy balances. In small catchments, other key ecohydrological processes need to be taken into account in order to fully capture the variability of the (sic) parameter in Fu's equation. Citation: Li, D., M. Pan, Z.

Historically, this was a critical part of the Silk Road, and it is now named the modern Silk Road Economic Belt. Using the Qilian Mountains and Hexi Corridor in China as a case-study of the inland region, we collected a total of 2311 water samples from the area and performed a comprehensive investigation of the water cycle. Results from stable isotope tracing indicate clear spatial patterns. In the upstream mountainous regions, glacier snow meltwater becomes groundwater at the periglacial belt. Supra-permafrost water develops into river runoff in the permafrost region. There are also frequent exchanges between groundwater and river runoff along the vegetation belt. In the middle/downstream region, river runoff becomes groundwater. Throughout these processes, both river runoff and groundwater are consumed by evapotranspiration, are recycled, and make a substantial contribution to precipitation. Overall, the upstream mountainous region is a critical part of the water resources. The cryosphere belt accounts for 44\% of the mountainous region but contributes to about 80\% of water resources. Recycling of moisture also plays an important role. During the summer months (May to September) moisture recycling accounted for 24\% and 14\% of precipitation in upstream and middle/downstream regions, respectively. The findings from the stable isotope tracing provide insights into hydrological processes and can help improve water management in inland regions of Central Asia.},

The results showed that the runoff showed a significant increasing trend from 1956 to 2018 and the runoff increased by 21.5 m(3)/s center dot 10a (Zhimenda station (ZMD)) and 40.0 m(3)/s center dot 10a (Tuotuohe station (TTH)), especially in dry season. Moreover, the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in dry season was more positive than that in wet season in the source region of Yangtze River. The main source of runoff in dry season is mainly affected by precipitation, supra-permafrost water and soil water in summer. Meanwhile, atmospheric precipitation, supra-permafrost water and soil water had a great impact on the recharge and the stable isotope characteristics of runoff of dry season. Furthermore, the hydrochemical type of runoff of dry season was similar as that for supra-permafrost water. Whether from the stable isotope or hydrochemical characteristics, it provides us with an idea that the main source of runoff of dry season is supra-permafrost water. Through the further analysis of recharge mode and recharge ratio of runoff of dry season, the major recharge sources of runoff of dry season is precipitation in autumn (TTH:58\%, ZMD:61\%). Moreover, the recharge patterns of runoff of dry season were direct recharge and indirect recharge. The subsequent findings could provide an overall understanding of the variational characteristics, causes, and sources of runoff of dry season and its hydrological effects in cold regions.},

This work aims to evaluate the hydrological performance of a monthly water balance model in Peru using precipitation and evapotranspiration data from the high-resolution meteorological PISCO dataset, which has been developed by the National Service of Meteorology and Hydrology of Peru (SENAMHI). A regionalization approach based on Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Testing (FAST) of the rainfall-runoff (RR) and runoff variability (RV) indices defined 14 calibration regions nationwide. Next, the GR2M model was used at a semi-distributed scale in 3594 sub-basins and river streams to simulate monthly discharges from January 1981 to March 2020. Model performance was evaluated using the Kling--Gupta efficiency (KGE), square root transferred Nash--Sutcliffe efficiency (NSEsqrt), and water balance error (WBE) metrics. The results show a very well representation of monthly discharges for a large portion of Peruvian sub-basins (KGE {$\geq$} 0.75, NSEsqrt {$\geq$} 0.65, and -0.29 {$<$} WBE {$<$} 0.23). Finally, this study introduces a product of continuous monthly discharge rates in Peru, named PISCO\_HyM\_GR2M, to understand surface water balance in data-scarce sub-basins.},

  abstract = {Proliferation of different total water storage (TWS) change products from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites, including the newly released mascon solution, warrants detailed analysis of their uncertainties and an urgent need to optimize different products for obtaining an elevated understanding of TWS changes globally. The three cornered hat method is used to quantify uncertainties in TWS changes from GRACE observations, land surface models, and global hydrological models, indicating that the WaterGap Global Hydrological Model (WGHM)-based TWS changes show the lowest uncertainty over sixty basins covering a range of climate settings and levels of human activities globally. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) using WGHM TWS output for training (2003-2006) is subsequently used to merge TWS changes from various GRACE products. Results indicate that the BMA-based TWS changes show the highest consistency with the WGHM output for the validation period (2007-2009) in terms of the highest medium of the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficient of 0.714 among all TWS change products for the sixty basins. The mascon solution shows a medium of NSE of 0.682, higher than other GRACE TWS change products. Analysis of spatiotemporal variability in BMA-based TWS changes and the mascon solution indicates that higher depletion rates for the 13-year period (Apr 2002-Mar 2015) occurred over major aquifers due to groundwater withdrawals for irrigation (e.g., Tigris, Central Valley, Ganges, upper Arkansas, and Indus), basins subject to great glacier and snow melting (e.g., Yukon, Fraser, and eastern Ganges), the north Caspian Sea (e.g., Don and Ural), and the Caspian Sea. Significant increasing trends in TWS are found over west (e.g., Gambia and Niger) and South Africa (e.g., Zambezi), South America (e.g., Essequibo), North America (e.g., Koksoak and Missouri), central India (e.g., Narmada and Godavari), the north Tibetan Plateau, and the middle Yangtze River basin. Empirical Orthogonal Function decomposition is used to investigate spatiotemporal variations in the GRACE mascon solution-based TWS changes during the study period, showing a detailed pattern of increasing and decreasing long-term trends, interannual and seasonal variations in TWS over the global land surface.

  abstract = {A considerable number of river basins around the world lack sufficient ground observations of hydro-meteorological data for effective water resources assessment and management. Several approaches can be developed to increase the quality and availability of data in these poorly gauged or ungauged river basins; among them, the use of Earth observations products has recently become promising. Earth observations of various environmental variables can be used potentially to increase knowledge about the hydrological processes in the basin and to improve streamflow model estimates, via assimilation or calibration. The present study aims to calibrate the large-scale hydrological model PCRaster GLOBal Water Balance (PCR-GLOBWB) using satellite-based products of evapotranspiration and soil moisture for the Moroccan Oum er Rbia River basin. Daily simulations at a spatial resolution of 5 {\texttimes} 5 arcmin are performed with varying parameters values for the 32-year period 1979--2010. Five different calibration scenarios are inter-compared: (i) reference scenario using the hydrological model with the standard parameterization, (ii) calibration using in situ-observed discharge time series, (iii) calibration using the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) actual evapotranspiration time series, (iv) calibration using ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) surface soil moisture time series and (v) step-wise calibration using GLEAM actual evapotranspiration and ESA CCI surface soil moisture time series. The impact on discharge estimates of precipitation in comparison with model parameters calibration is investigated using three global precipitation products, including ERA-Interim (EI), WATCH Forcing methodology applied to ERA-Interim reanalysis data (WFDEI) and Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation data by merging gauge, satellite and reanalysis data (MSWEP).   Results show that GLEAM evapotranspiration and ESA CCI soil moisture may be used for model calibration resulting in reasonable discharge estimates (NSE values from 0.5 to 0.75), although better model performance is achieved when the model is calibrated with in situ streamflow observations. Independent calibration based on only evapotranspiration or soil moisture observations improves model predictions to a lesser extent. Precipitation input affects discharge estimates more than calibrating model parameters. The use of WFDEI precipitation leads to the lowest model performances. Apart from the in situ discharge calibration scenario, the highest discharge improvement is obtained when EI and MSWEP precipitation products are used in combination with a step-wise calibration approach based on evapotranspiration and soil moisture observations. This study opens up the possibility of using globally available Earth observations and reanalysis products of precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture in large-scale hydrological models to estimate discharge at a river basin scale.},

  abstract = {European monthly temperatures undergo strong fluctuations from one year to the other. The variability is controlled by natural processes such as Atlantic cycles, changes in solar activity, volcanic eruptions, unforced internal atmospheric variability, as well as anthropogenic factors. This contribution investigates the role of key natural drivers for European temperature variability, namely the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and solar activity changes. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients r for AMO, NAO and sunspots compared to monthly temperature data of 39 European countries for the period 1901--2015 in order to search for `fingerprints' of the natural drivers. A cross correlation window of 11 months was chosen for AMO, NAO and of 120 months for SILSO to account for possible time lags or phase shifts. The r coefficients were mapped out across Europe on a monthly basis to document regional and seasonal changes of the correlation strength. The NAO dominates European temperature variability during the winter months, with strongest relationship in February. The AMO modulates temperatures in March to November, with best corre\- lations occurring in summer, but also in April. Regions of strongest AMO and NAO impacts shift across the continent from month to month, forming systematic patterns. Direct correlation of the solar 11-year Schwabe cycle with temperatures was identified only in some countries in certain multidecadal intervals during February, March, June and September. Previous studies have suggested a significant solar influence on the AMO and NAO. It is likely that the greatest impact of solar activity on European temperatures is of a non-linear, indirect nature by way of interaction with Atlantic cycles.},

  abstract = {The present study aimed to evaluate the performance of 46 global climate models (GCMs) from the newly released Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) in the historical simulation of precipitation and temperature, and select the best performing GCMs for future projection across China and three major river basins. This study uses four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), namely SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 relative to the base period (1961-2014). Initially, 46 models were evaluated across China employing an improved Taylor diagram method. Based on relatively better performance, 10 best-performing models (TBMs) were selected out of 46 models for further evaluation. The results show that historical temperature was well reproduced by CMIP6 over the study regions with a high correlation coefficient (CC). All the TBMs produced good CC ranging from 0.8 to 0.99 presenting the precipitation and temperature distribution well. Meanwhile, EC-Earth3 and EC-Earth3-Veg well simulated the precipitation and temperature amounts as well as trends over selected three river basins. The multimodel ensemble mean (MME) underestimates temperature over China and selected three basins with bias values of -0.53, -0.21, -0.91, and -0.68 degrees C, respectively. In contrast, MEM overestimated the simulated precipitation with the amount of 27.7, 32.4, 21.0, and 104.6\% across China and selected three basins. During future projections, increased precipitation and temperature trends are projected over three selected river basins as well as all across China. The increasing trend of future precipitation over China under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios are 0.65, 0.86, 1.29, and 0.76 mm center dot a(-1), whereas, the increasing trend of temperature is 0.008, 0.028, 0.050, and 0.065 degrees C center dot a(-1), respectively. Comparatively, the greater the radiation force, the higher projected increases in precipitation and temperature across China and three major river basins were observed. The extent of CMIP6 models over the target region and its river basins calls for further deep assessment of the attribution and possible implementation of robust methods that can accurately simulate the observed patterns for future practice.},

To update the 2008 to 2015 data, supplementary calculations were performed for {$>$}120 meteorological stations. A linear regression of the least squares method was used to calculate trend magnitudes. Trend significance was tested using the Mann-Kendall method. Changes in short-term trend frequency and temporal coherence were assessed. Extreme precipitation was defined as a daily amount exceeding the 95th percentile, calculated separately for each month and station using daily totals {$\geq$}1 mm. The spatial pattern of extreme precipitation trends varied by season. Significant extreme precipitation trends were rare, constituting approximately 25 to 30\% of all analysed trends, and were seldom temporally coherent. Most of these significant trends were upward, except in summer, when a nearly equal frequency of positive and negative trends was found. Increases in the frequency and the total were a characteristic feature of extreme precipitation changes, particularly in winter. Seasonal variations in the spatial patterns of extreme precipitation trends may have resulted from seasonal changes in the prominence of the driving factors of precipitation. In spring, upward trends in Central and Western Europe were twice as frequent as the downward trends found primarily in Southern Europe. In summer, the percentages of significant downward trends in Western Europe and upward trends in Eastern Europe were similar. In autumn, a coherent decrease in extreme precipitation was clear in Central Europe. The spatial distribution of trend directions was the most consistent in winter.},

Climate change alters the hydrology and causes shifts in the timing, composition and magnitude of these sources of water supply. Simultaneously, socio-economic growth increases water demand. Here we use a high-resolution cryosphere--hydrology--crop model forced with an ensemble of climate and socio-economic projections to assess how the sources of irrigation water supply may shift during the twenty-first century. We find increases in the importance of meltwater and groundwater for irrigated agriculture. An earlier melt peak increases meltwater withdrawal at the onset of the cropping season in May and June in the Indus, whereas increasing peak irrigation water demand during July and August aggravates non-renewable groundwater pumping in the Indus and Ganges despite runoff increases. Increasing inter-annual variability in rainfall runoff increases the need for meltwater and groundwater to complement rainfall runoff during future dry years.},

The modeled ETa rates were first validated against 13 eddy-covariance measurements, producing Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values in the range of 0.72-0.94. On the basin scale, the modeled ETa values yielded a relative bias of 6\%, and a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency value of 0.80 in comparison with water-balance-derived evapotranspiration rates across 10 major river basins in China, indicating the CR-simulated ETa rates reliable over China. Further evaluations suggest that the CR-based ETa product is more accurate than seven other mainstream ETa products. The 31-year mean annual ETa value decreases from the southeast to the northwest in China, resulting in a country average of 406 +/- 15 mm/year. The country-representative annual ETa rates slightly decreased with a rate of -0.5 mm/year (p = 0.86) during 1982-2012. Annual ETa increased significantly over most parts of western and northeastern China but decreased significantly in many regions of the North China Plain as well as in the eastern and southern coastal regions. The present CR-based method, with its calibration-free nature and minimal data requirement, could help future calibrations/verifications of the more complex and more data-intensive land surface model-and remote sensing-based models.},

  abstract = {The Gediz River, one of the principal rivers of Western Anatolia, has an extensive Pleistocene fluvial archive that potentially offers a unique window into fluvial system behaviour on the western margins of Asia during the Quaternary. In this paper we review our work on the Quaternary Gediz River Project (2001-2010) and present new data which leads to a revised stratigraphical model for the Early Pleistocene development of this fluvial system. In previous work we confirmed the preservation of eleven buried Early Pleistocene fluvial terraces of the Gediz River (designated GT11, the oldest and highest, to GT1, the youngest and lowest) which lie beneath the basalt-covered plateaux of the Kula Volcanic Province. Deciphering the information locked in this fluvial archive requires the construction of a robust geochronology. Fortunately, the Gediz archive provides ample opportunity for age-constraint based upon age estimates derived from basaltic lava flows that repeatedly entered the palaeo-Gediz valley floors. In this paper we present, for the first time, our complete dataset of 40Ar/39Ar age estimates and associated palaeomagnetic measurements. These data, which can be directly related to the underlying fluvial deposits, provide age constraints critical to our understanding of this sequence. The new chronology establishes the onset of Quaternary volcanism at similar to 1320ka (MIS42). This volcanism, which is associated with GT6, confirms a pre-MIS42 age for terraces GT11-GT7. Evidence from the colluvial sequences directly overlying these early terraces suggests that they formed in response to hydrological and sediment budget changes forced by climate-driven vegetation change. The cyclic formation of terraces and their timing suggests they represent the obliquity -driven climate changes of the Early Pleistocene. By way of contrast the GT5-GT1 terrace sequence, constrained by a lava flow with an age estimate of similar to 1247ka, span the time-interval MIS42-MIS38 and therefore do not match the frequency of climate change as previously suggested. The onset of volcanism breaks the simple linkage of terracing to climate-driven change. These younger terraces more likely reflect a localized terracing process triggered by base level changes forced by volcanic eruptions and associated reactivation of preexisting faults, lava dam construction, landsliding and subsequent lava-dammed lake drainage. Establishing a firm stratigraphy and geochronology for the Early Pleistocene archive provides a secure framework for future exploitation of this part of the archive and sets the standard as we begin our work on the Middle-Late Pleistocene sequence.

By way of contrast the GT5-GT1 terrace sequence, constrained by a lava flow with an age estimate of similar to 1247ka, span the time-interval MIS42-MIS38 and therefore do not match the frequency of climate change as previously suggested. The onset of volcanism breaks the simple linkage of terracing to climate-driven change. These younger terraces more likely reflect a localized terracing process triggered by base level changes forced by volcanic eruptions and associated reactivation of preexisting faults, lava dam construction, landsliding and subsequent lava-dammed lake drainage. Establishing a firm stratigraphy and geochronology for the Early Pleistocene archive provides a secure framework for future exploitation of this part of the archive and sets the standard as we begin our work on the Middle-Late Pleistocene sequence. We believe this work forms a benchmark study for detailed Quaternary research in Turkey. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {General circulation models (GCMs) run at regional resolution or at a continental scale. Therefore, these results cannot be used directly for local temperatures and precipitation prediction. Downscaling techniques are required to calibrate GCMs. Statistical downscaling models (SDSM) are the most widely used for bias correction of GCMs. However, few studies have compared SDSM with multi-layer perceptron artificial neural networks and in most of these studies, results indicate that SDSM outperform other approaches. This paper investigates an alternative architecture of neural networks, namely the long-short-term memory (LSTM), to forecast two critical climate variables, namely temperature and precipitation, with an application to five climate gauging stations in the Lake Chad Basin. Lake Chad is a data scarce area which has been impacted by severe drought, where water resources have been influenced by climate change and recent agricultural expansion. SDSM was used as the benchmark in this paper for temperature and precipitation downscaling for monthly time-scales weather prediction, using grid resolution GCM output at a 5 degrees latitude x 5 degrees longitude global grid. Three performance indicators were used in this study, namely the root mean square error (RMSE), to measure the sensitivity of the model to outliers, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), to estimate the overall performance of the predictions, as well as the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), which is a standard measure used in the field of climate forecasting. Results on the validation set for SDSM and test set for LSTM indicated that LSTM produced better accuracy on average compared to SDSM. For precipitation forecasting, the average RMSE and MAPE for LSTM were 33.21 mm and 24.82\% respectively, while the average RMSE and MAPE for SDSM were 53.32 mm and 34.62\% respectively. In terms of three year ahead minimum temperature forecasts, LSTM presents an average RMSE of 4.96 degree celsius and an average MAPE of 27.16\%, while SDSM presents an average RMSE of 8.58 degree celsius and an average MAPE of 12.83\%. For maximum temperatures forecast, LSTM presents an average RMSE of 4.27 degree celsius and an average MAPE of 11.09 percent, while SDSM presents an average RMSE of 9.93 degree celsius and an average RMSE of 12.07\%. Given the results, LSTM may be a suitable alternative approach to downscale global climate simulation models' output, to improve water management and long-term temperature and precipitations forecasting at local level.},

  abstract = {Snow is a vital resource for a host of natural and human systems. Global warming is projected to drive widespread decreases in snow accumulation by the end of the century, potentially affecting water, food, and energy supplies, seasonal heat extremes, and wildfire risk. However, over the next few decades, when the planning and implementation of current adaptation responses are most relevant, the snow response is more uncertain, largely because of uncertainty in regional and local precipitation trends. We use a large (40-member) single-model ensemble climate model experiment to examine the influence of precipitation variability on the direction and magnitude of near-term Northern Hemisphere snow trends. We find that near-term uncertainty in the sign of regional precipitation change does not cascade into uncertainty in the sign of regional snow accumulation change. Rather, temperature increases drive statistically robust consistency in the sign of future near-term snow accumulation trends, with all regions exhibiting reductions in the fraction of precipitation falling as snow, along with mean decreases in late-season snow accumulation. However, internal variability does create uncertainty in the magnitude of hemispheric and regional snow changes, including uncertainty as large as 33~\% of the baseline mean. In addition, within the 40-member ensemble, many mid-latitude grid points exhibit at least one realization with a statistically significant positive trend in net snow accumulation, and at least one realization with a statistically significant negative trend. These results suggest that the direction of near-term snow accumulation change is robust at the regional scale, but that internal variability can influence the magnitude and direction of snow accumulation changes at the local scale, even in areas that exhibit a high signal-to-noise ratio.},

  abstract = {Plants are expected to generate more global-scale runoff under increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations through their influence on surface resistance to evapotranspiration. Recent studies using Earth System Models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project ostensibly reaffirm this result, further suggesting that plants will ameliorate the dire reductions in water availability projected by other studies that use aridity metrics. Here we complicate this narrative by analysing the change in precipitation partitioning to plants, runoff and storage in multiple Earth system models under both high carbon dioxide concentrations and warming. We show that projected plant responses directly reduce future runoff across vast swaths of North America, Europe and Asia because bulk canopy water demands increase with additional vegetation growth and longer and warmer growing seasons. These runoff declines occur despite increased surface resistance to evapotranspiration and vegetation total water use efficiency, even in regions with increasing or unchanging precipitation. We demonstrate that constraining the large uncertainty in the multimodel ensemble with regional-scale observations of evapotranspiration partitioning strengthens these results. We conclude that terrestrial vegetation plays a large and unresolved role in shaping future regional freshwater availability, one that will not ubiquitously ameliorate future warming-driven surface drying.},

Our study portrays the added value of the CMIP6 ensemble over CMIP5 in a first North America wide comparison using 3,107 catchments. Results show a reduced spread of the CMIP6 ensemble compared to the CMIP5 ensemble for temperature and precipitation projections. In terms of flow indicators, the CMIP6 driven hydrological projections result in a smaller spread of future mean and high flow values, except for mountainous areas. Overall, we assess that the CMIP6 ensemble provides a narrower band of uncertainty of future climate projections, bringing more confidence for hydrological impact studies.},

  abstract = {Continental-scale water balance (WB) assessments are important for characterizing hydrologic systems and understanding regional-scale dynamics and for identifying hydroclimatic trends and systematic data biases. However, it is not clear whether existing models can reproduce the catchment dynamics observed in nature. Nor has our ability to evaluate model results kept pace with computational and data processing abilities. Consequently, methods for diagnostic model evaluation and improvement remain weak. There is a need for well-conceived, systematic strategies to guide model selection, establish data requirements, estimate parameters, and evaluate and track model performance. We examine these challenges in the context of monthly WB modeling for the conterminous United States by applying the ``abcd'' model to 764 catchments selected for their comprehensive coverage of hydrogeological conditions. By examining diagnostically relevant components of model error, we evaluate the details of its spatial variability across the continental United States. Model performance, parameters, and structures are found to be correlated with hydroclimatic variables. However, our results indicate a need for the conventional identification approach to be improved. Because they do not constrain models to reproduce important hydrological behaviors, reported values of NSE or r2 performance can be misleading. Further, we must establish suitable model hypotheses with appropriate spatiotemporal scale for each hydroclimatic region. Until these issues are resolved, such models cannot reliably be used to infer the spatiotemporal dynamics of continental-scale water balance or to regionalize model structures and parameters to ungaged locations.},

Increasing greenhouse gas concentrations are thought to affect the zonal-mean distribution of precipitation through two basic mechanisms. First, increasing temperatures will lead to an intensification of the hydrological cycle (``thermodynamic'' changes). Second, changes in atmospheric circulation patterns will lead to poleward displacement of the storm tracks and subtropical dry zones and to a widening of the tropical belt (``dynamic'' changes). We demonstrate that both these changes are occurring simultaneously in global precipitation, that this behavior cannot be explained by internal variability alone, and that external influences are responsible for the observed precipitation changes. Whereas existing model experiments are not of sufficient length to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic forcing terms at the 95\% confidence level, we present evidence that the observed trends result from human activities.},

It also estimated the West African Monsoon (WAM) wind shear index and related it to the WAM dynamics during different seasons (December to February: DJF; March to May: MAM, June to August: JJA; September to November: SON). The computed wind shear indices were compared with those derived from higher-resolution datasets of ERA5. Results revealed very similar spatial and seasonal distributions of wind patterns and significant positive correlations (0.75 {\dbend} r {\dbend} 0.99; p {\dbend} 0.05) between NCEP and ERA5 over West African onshore region. We obtained both positive and negative trends in wind shears ({\`A} 0.001 to {\`A} 0.05 units per year) and precipitation ({\`A} 1.5 to {\`A} 3.5 mm per year) over the entire study period and region. However, the trends were found to be statistically insignificant at 95\% confidence level. The WAM wind shear index (WAMI) effectively captured the northward migration of the monsoon system over West Africa with peak values in JJA season. We established significant and strong associations between wind shear indices and precipitation climatology of the Climate Research Unit. The deep layer shear (0--6 km above ground level) and WAMI gave significant and positive correlation (0.75 {\dbend} r {\dbend} 0.95) with convective precipitation while fluctuation in pre\- cipitation was explained by 50--75\% variations in these indices over most parts of the monsoon region. We concluded that convective precipitation was significantly influenced by seasonal variations in wind shears over West Africa.},

  abstract = {This guide to estimating daily and monthly actual, potential, reference crop and pan evaporation covers topics that are of interest to researchers, consulting hydrologists and practicing engineers. Topics include estimating actual evaporation from deep lakes and from farm dams and for catchment water balance studies, estimating potential evaporation as input to rainfall-runoff models, and reference crop evapotranspiration for small irrigation areas, and for irrigation within large irrigation districts. Inspiration for this guide arose in response to the authors' experiences in reviewing research papers and consulting reports where estimation of the actual evaporation component in catchment and water balance studies was often inadequately handled. Practical guides using consistent terminology that cover both theory and practice are not readily available. Here we provide such a guide, which is divided into three parts. The first part provides background theory and an outline of the conceptual models of potential evaporation of Penman, Penman-Monteith and Priestley-Taylor, as well as discussions of reference crop evapotranspiration and Class-A pan evaporation. The last two sub-sections in this first part include techniques to estimate actual evaporation from (i) open-surface water and (ii) landscapes and catchments (Morton and the advection-aridity models). The second part addresses topics confronting a practicing hydrologist, e. g. estimating actual evaporation for deep lakes, shallow lakes and farm dams, lakes covered with vegetation, catchments, irrigation areas and bare soil. The third part addresses six related issues: (i) automatic (hard wired) calculation of evaporation estimates in commercial weather stations, (ii) evaporation estimates without wind data, (iii) at-site meteorological data, (iv) dealing with evaporation in a climate change environment, (v) 24 h versus day-light hour estimation of meteorological variables, and (vi) uncertainty in evaporation estimates. This paper is supported by a Supplement that includes 21 sections enhancing the material in the text, worked examples of many procedures discussed in the paper, a program listing (Fortran 90) of Morton's WREVAP evaporation models along with tables of monthly Class-A pan coefficients for 68 locations across Australia and other information.},

  abstract = {Nationwide predictions of flow time-series are valuable for development of policies relating to environmental flows, calculating reliability of supply to water users, or assessing risk of floods or droughts. This breadth of model utility is possible because various hydrological signatures can be derived from simulated flow time-series. However, producing national hydrological simulations can be challenging due to strong environmental diversity across catchments and a lack of data available to aid model parameterisation. A comprehensive and consistent suite of test procedures to quantify spatial and temporal patterns in performance across various parts of the hydrograph is described and applied to quantify the performance of an uncalibrated national rainfall-runoff model of New Zealand. Flow time-series observed at 485 gauging stations were used to calculate Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and percent bias when simulating between-site differences in daily series, between-year differences in annual series, and between-site differences in hydrological signatures. The procedures were used to assess the benefit of applying a correction to the modelled flow duration curve based on an independent statistical analysis. They were used to aid understanding of climatological, hydrological and model-based causes of differences in predictive performance by assessing multiple hypotheses that describe where and when the model was expected to perform best. As the procedures produce quantitative measures of performance, they provide an objective basis for model assessment that could be applied when comparing observed daily flow series with competing simulated flow series from any region-wide or nationwide hydrological model. Model performance varied in space and time with better scores in larger and medium-wet catchments, and in catchments with smaller seasonal variations. Surprisingly, model performance was not sensitive to aquifer fraction or rain gauge density.},

  abstract = {Abstract. From the Hindu Kush mountains to the Registan Desert, Afghanistan is a diverse landscape where droughts, floods, conflict, and economic market accessibility pose challenges for agricultural livelihoods and food security. The ability to remotely monitor environmental conditions is critical to support decision making for humanitarian assistance. The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) global and Central Asia data streams provide information on hydrologic states for routine integrated food security analysis. While developed for a specific project, these data are publicly available and useful for other applications that require hydrologic estimates of the water and energy balance. These two data streams are unique because of their suitability for routine monitoring, as well as for being a historical record for computing relative indicators of water availability. The global stream is available at {$\sim$}\,1-month latency, and monthly average outputs are on a 10\,km grid from 1982--present. The second data stream, Central Asia (21--56{$\circ$}\,N, 30--100{$\circ$}\,E), at {$\sim$}\,1\,d latency, provides daily average outputs on a 1\,km grid from 2000--present. This paper describes the configuration of the two FLDAS data streams, background on the software modeling framework, selected meteorological inputs and parameters, and results from previous evaluation studies. We also provide additional analysis of precipitation and snow cover over Afghanistan. We conclude with an example of how these data are used in integrated food security analysis. For use in new and innovative studies that will improve understanding of this region, these data are hosted by U.S. Geological Survey data portals and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

Sediment in the lower reaches of these great rivers is deposited and stored (permanently, on a millennial time scale) in flood plains. Sediment discharges, already small under natural conditions, are diminished further by large manmade reservoirs that trap significant proportions of the moving solids. The long winter freeze and sudden spring breakup impose a peakedness in seasonal water runoff and sediment discharge that contrasts markedly with that in rivers of the tropics and more temperate climates. Very little sediment from the Ob and Yenisey rivers is being transported to the open waters of the Arctic Ocean under present conditions.},

Meanwhile, the range of transient climate response (TCR, the surface temperature warming around the time of CO2 doubling in a 1\% per year CO2 increase simulation) for the CMIP6 models of 1.7 degrees C (1.3 degrees C to 3.0 degrees C) is only slightly larger than for the CMIP3 and CMIP5 models. Here we review and synthesize the latest developments in ECS and TCR values in CMIP, compile possible reasons for the current values as supplied by the modeling groups, and highlight future directions.

  abstract = {A novel approach is taken to the problem of estimating global water scarcity, using a realistic and consistent procedure applied across many countries. Water demands, surface flows and groundwater availability are estimated on a gridded basis, and various water availability indices are derived comparing the resource with the projected demand. Surface flows are estimated using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model linking climate to runoff and, in the major river basins, the runoff estimates for individual grid cells are accumulated to give estimates for the total flows at all points of interest. Groundwater availability is derived from hydrogeological maps based on estimates of the potential yield that can be expected from a borehole and the likely maximum borehole density. Estimates of potential groundwater recharge derived from the surface water model are also taken into account. Water demands are based on current and projected population and livestock numbers, and information on irrigation schemes and industrial water use. Results are presented for the application of the model to a region covering the whole of eastern and southern Africa. The main scenario considered includes the combined impact of climate change, population growth and improved living standards to the year 2050. The results for this scenario show that water scarcity is likely to increase in many countries in the region, with particular problems in the countries around Lake Victoria and in the southernmost parts of the pilot region.},

Half a billion people in the world face severe water scarcity all year round.

In this paper we calibrate the parameters of a conceptual rainfall-runoff model to six consecutive 5 year periods between 1976 and 2006 for 273 catchments in Austria and analyze the temporal change of the calibrated parameters. The calibrated parameters representing snow and soil moisture processes show significant trends. For example, the parameter controlling runoff generation doubled, on average, in the 3 decades. Comparisons of different subregions, comparisons with independent data sets, and analyses of the spatial variability of the model parameters indicate that these trends represent hydrological changes rather than calibration artifacts. The trends can be related to changes in the climatic conditions of the catchments such as higher evapotranspiration and drier catchment conditions in the more recent years. The simulations suggest that the impact on simulated runoff of assuming time invariant parameters can be very significant. For example, if using the parameters calibrated to 1976-1981 for simulating runoff for the period 2001-2006, the biases of median flows are, on average, 15\% and the biases of high flows are about 35\%. The errors increase as the time lag between the simulation and calibration periods increases. The implications for hydrologic prediction in general and climate impact analyses in particular are discussed.},

  abstract = {Evaporation is a crucial flux in the hydrological cycle and links the water and energy balance of a catchment. The Budyko framework is often used to provide a first-order estimate of evaporation, as it is a straightforward model with only rainfall and potential evaporation as required input. Many researchers have improved the Budyko framework by including more physics and catchment characteristics in the original equation. However, the parameterization of these improved Budyko models is not so straightforward, is data demanding, and requires local knowledge that is difficult to obtain at the global scale. In this paper we present an improvement of the previously presented Gerrits' model (``Analytical derivation of the Budyko curve based on rainfall characteristics and a simple evaporation model'' in Gerrits et al., 2009 WRR), whereby total evaporation is calculated on the basis of simple interception and transpiration thresholds in combination with measurable parameters like rainfall dynamics and storage availability from remotely sensed data sources. While Gerrits' model was previously investigated for 10 catchments with different climate conditions and where some parameters were assumed to be constant, in this study we applied the model at the global scale and fed the model with remotely sensed input data. The output of the model has been compared to two complex land-surface models, STEAM and GLEAM, as well as the database of Landflux-EVAL. Our results show that total evaporation estimated by Gerrits' model is in good agreement with Landflux-EVAL, STEAM, and GLEAM. The results also show that Gerrits' model underestimates interception in comparison to STEAM and overestimates it in comparison to GLEAM, whereas the opposite is found for transpiration. Errors in interception can partly be explained by differences in the definition of interception that successively introduce errors in the calculation of transpiration. Relating to the Budyko framework, the model shows a reasonable performance for the estimation of total evaporation. The results also found a unimodal distribution of the transpiration to precipitation fraction (EtP), indicating that both increasing and decreasing aridity will result in a decline in the fraction of transpired rainfall by plants for growth and metabolism.},

In China, previous reconstructions from sparse and poor-quality gauge measurements have led to large biases in simulation of the interannual and seasonal variability of natural flows. Here we use a well-trained and tested land surface model coupled to a routing model with flow direction correction to reconstruct the first high-quality gauge-based natural streamflow dataset for China, covering all its 330 catchments during the period from 1961 to 2018. A stronger positive linear relationship holds between upstream routing cells and drainage areas, after flow direction correction to 330 catchments. We also introduce a parameter-uncertainty analysis framework including sensitivity analysis, optimization, and regionalization, which further minimizes biases between modeled and inferred natural streamflow from natural or near-natural gauges. The resulting behavior of the natural hydrological system is represented properly by the model which achieves high skill metric values of the monthly streamflow, with about 83\% of the 330 catchments having Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE)~{$>~$}0.7, and about 56\% of the 330 catchments having Kling-Gupta efficiency coefficient (KGE)~{$>~$}0.7. The proposed construction scheme has important implications for similar simulation studies in other regions, and the developed low bias long-term national datasets by statistical postprocessing should be useful in supporting river management activities in China.},

We analyze the runoff changes from model outputs of the 5th and 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIP5 and CMIP6) and decompose the uncertainty of projected runoff changes into three main sources: internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty. The results indicate that 73\% and 72\% of the global land area, respectively, shows an increase in runoff for CMIP5 and CMIP6 under the high-emissions scenarios in the long term (2070-2099) relative to 1970-1999, and runoff across all global land increases by 10.8\% under the RCP8.5 scenario and 16.1\% under SSP5-8.5 during 2070-2099 relative to 1970-1999. Regions with increasing runoff are mainly in Southeast Asia, eastern Africa, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Model agreement during 2070-2099 for runoff changes under the high-emissions scenarios is greater than under the low-emissions scenarios. For uncertainty of relative changes in runoff (RRC) in CMIP6, the contribution from internal variability gradually decreases over time (from 49.2\% to 2.0\%) while the contribution from scenario uncertainty increases (from 0.6\% to 30.0\%); this result is similar in CMIP5. Spatially, model uncertainty in RRC has been a major source of uncertainty for CMIP5 and CMIP6, accounting for more than 60\% of total uncertainty in most regions. The results of this study help us to better understand the uncertainty in runoff changes and also provide a theoretical basis for developing mitigation measures for future changes.},

  abstract = {The water shortage in the Yellow River, China, has been aggravated by rapid population growth and global climate changes. To identify the characteristics of streamflow change in the Yellow River, approximately 50 years of natural and observed streamflow data from 23 hydrological stations were examined. The Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests were used to detect trends and abrupt change points. The results show that both the natural and the observed streamflow in the Yellow River basin present downward trends from 1956 to 2008, and the decreasing rate of observed streamflow is generally faster than that of the natural streamflow. Larger drainage areas have higher declining rates, and the declining trends are intensified downstream within the mainstream. The possibility of abrupt changes in observed streamflow is higher than in natural streamflow, and streamflow series in the mainstream are more likely to change abruptly than those in the tributaries. In the mainstream, all the significant abrupt changes appear in the middle and latter half of the 1980s, but the abrupt changes occur somewhat earlier for observed streamflow than for natural streamflow. The significant abrupt change for the observed streamflow in the tributaries is almost isochronous with the natural streamflow and occurs from the 1970s to 1990s. It is implied that the slight reduction in precipitation is not the only direct reason for the streamflow variation. Other than the effects of climate change, land-use and land-cover changes are the main reasons for the natural streamflow change. Therefore, the increasing net water diversion by humans is responsible for the observed streamflow change. It is estimated that the influence of human activity on the declining streamflow is enhanced over time.},

  abstract = {During the last half of the 20th century, cumulative annual discharge from 137 representative rivers (watershed areas ranging from 0.3 to 6300x 10(3) km(2)) to the global ocean remained constant, although annual discharge from about one-third of these rivers changed by more than 30\%. Discharge trends for many rivers reflected mostly changes in precipitation, primarily in response to short- and longer-term atmospheric-oceanic signals; with the notable exception of the Parana, Mississippi, Niger and Cunene rivers, few of these "normal" rivers experienced significant changes in either discharge or precipitation. Cumulative discharge from many mid-latitude rivers, in contrast, decreased by 60\%, reflecting in large part impacts due to damming, irrigation and interbasin water transfers. A number of high-latitude and high-altitude rivers experienced increased discharge despite generally declining precipitation. Poorly constrained meteorological and hydrological data do not seem to explain fully these "excess" rivers; changed seasonality in discharge, decreased storage and/or decreased evapotranspiration also may play important roles.

  abstract = {Water availability on the continents is important for human health(1,2), economic activity(3), ecosystem function(4) and geophysical processes(5). Because the saturation vapour pressure of water in air is highly sensitive to temperature, perturbations in the global water cycle are expected to accompany climate warming(6). Regional patterns of warming-induced changes in surface hydroclimate are complex and less certain than those in temperature, however, with both regional increases and decreases expected in precipitation and runoff. Here we show that an ensemble of 12 climate models exhibits qualitative and statistically significant skill in simulating observed regional patterns of twentieth-century multidecadal changes in streamflow. These models project 10-40\% increases in runoff in eastern equatorial Africa, the La Plata basin and high-latitude North America and Eurasia, and 10-30\% decreases in runoff in southern Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East and mid-latitude western North America by the year 2050. Such changes in sustainable water availability would have considerable regional-scale consequences for economies as well as ecosystems.},

Here, we develop daily bias-corrected data of precipitation, maximum and minimum temperatures at 0.25 degrees spatial resolution for South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka) and 18 river basins located in the Indian sub-continent. The bias-corrected dataset is developed using Empirical Quantile Mapping (EQM) for the historic (1951-2014) and projected (2015-2100) climate for the four scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585) using output from 13 General Circulation Models (GCMs) from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-6 (CMIP6). The bias-corrected dataset was evaluated against the observations for both mean and extremes of precipitation, maximum and minimum temperatures. Bias corrected projections from 13 CMIP6-GCMs project a warmer (3-5 degrees C) and wetter (13-30\%) climate in South Asia in the 21(st) century. The bias-corrected projections from CMIP6-GCMs can be used for climate change impact assessment in South Asia and hydrologic impact assessment in the sub-continental river basins.

The work differs from previous modelling work on the basin in that it accounts the spatial variability of the flow parameters. The study illustrates that velocity is a more significant parameter in determining the response of the basin. The key inference from the simulation with spatially variable parameters is that, if variable velocity zones exist in a basin, then it is important to consider the effect of non-uniform dispersion coefficients as well.

  abstract = {Estimating spatially distributed parameters remains one of the biggest challenges for large-domain hydrologic modeling. Many large-domain modeling efforts rely on spatially inconsistent parameter fields, e.g., patchwork patterns resulting from individual basin calibrations, parameter fields generated through default transfer functions that relate geophysical attributes to model parameters, or spatially constant, default parameter values. This paper provides an initial assessment of a multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR) method over large geographical domains to derive seamless parameters in a spatially consistent manner. MPR applies transfer functions at the native scale of the geophysical data, and then scales these model parameters to the desired model resolution. We developed a stand-alone framework called MPR-flex for multimodel use and applied MPR-flex to the variable infiltration capacity model to produce hydrologic simulations over the contiguous United States (CONUS). We first independently calibrate 531 basins across CONUS to obtain a performance benchmark for each basin. To derive the CONUS parameter fields, we perform a joint MPR calibration using all but the poorest behaved basins to obtain a single set of transfer function parameters that are applied to the entire CONUS. Results show that CONUS-wide calibration has similar performance compared to previous simulations using a patchwork quilt of partially calibrated parameter sets, but without the spatial discontinuities in parameters that characterize some previous CONUS-domain model simulations. Several avenues to improve CONUS-wide calibration remain, including selection of calibration basins, objective function formulation, as well as MPR-flex improvements including transfer function formulations and scaling operator optimization. Plain Language Summary Hydrologic models compute surface and subsurface water transmission and storage using many equations with parameters that vary spatially. Many parameter values are commonly estimated through systematic adjustment of parameter values to match historical streamflow over a watershed where a stream gauge is available. This method is difficult to apply to large domains contiguously. Consequently, many current large scale hydrologic assessments rely on spatially inconsistent parameter fields such as a patchwork quilt resulting from individual basin calibration or spatially constant parameters resulting from the adoption of default estimates. Facing this challenge, we developed a parameter estimation methodology that incorporates effects of landscape properties on parameter values to enable continental-domain applications of hydrologic models in a spatially consistent way. We applied this methodology to a model that has been used for many hydrologic studies such as climate impact studies to generate a spatially smooth parameter set over the contiguous United States. Simulations using this parameter set produce similar accuracy to the previously developed parameter set.},

California as one of the leading States in increasing renewable energy utilization, having established a Renewables Portfolios to meet its electricity demand from renewable energy resources. In this study, long-term 50 years datasets (1961-2010) of eight locations representing different climate conditions of California are utilized. The main objective of this work is to investigate the sensitivity of H, V and P and their variation to El Nino events (very strong and strong El Nino) and La Nina events (strong and moderate La Nino) in different regions of California. The results showed distinct impacts of El Nino and La Nina events on the magnitude and distribution of the studied meteorological variables. The impact of ENSO events on these variables are found to be geographically and seasonally dependent. Furthermore, the degree to which the variables link to ENSO depends on intensity of the events. Overall, the results suggest that ENSO is a potentially useful prognostic tool for California solar and wind energy and hydropower planning for upcoming events. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The Nile River is one of the principal rivers in Africa, with Blue Nile (BNRiF) and Tekeze-Atbara (TARiF) rivers being its largest tributaries. However, long-term hydrological information is lacking in the Nile basin, which is a shortcoming to design and implement sustainable water management. We reconstructed river discharge since A.D. 1784 using tree-ring proxy data to (1) extend the short existing discharge records (2) examine long-term flow variability, and (3) identify characteristics of high- and low-flow periods and their connection with large-scale climate forcing factors like the El Nin{\textasciitilde}oeSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole Mode (IOD). The chronology (RPC\#1) correlates significantly with annual BNRiF (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.62, p {$<$} 0.001) and TARiF (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} . 66, p {$<$}. 001) discharge. Reconstructed river discharge showed significant high-frequency variations at 2- to 4-year cycles, and sub-decadal and decadal periodicities at 7e10 and 10e14 years, respectively. The inter-annual discharge deviations from the mean during pluvial (dry) periods reached up to 38\% ({\`A}32\%) in BNRiF and 76\% ({\`A}65\%) in TARiF. El Nin{\textasciitilde}o and La Nin{\textasciitilde}a events matched with 40\% and 59\% of extreme-dry and extreme-pluvial episodes, indicating teleconnections influencing the regional rainfall and hydrological system. Reconstructed river discharge showed significantly positive spatial relationships with rainfall and negative spatial correlations with temperature across northern Ethiopia and large parts of the Sahel belt and the White Nile swamps in South Sudan. The short instrumental period did not adequately represent the full range of annual to multidecadal discharge variability present in the reconstruction. Hence, the data presented are crucial to extend hydrological records and to revise existing worst-case scenarios and water management strategies developed based on short instrumental records for water supply and energy production across the Nile basin.},

  abstract = {Given that land surface processes most often depend nonlinearly on soil moisture and that coarse-grained soil moisture fields are often used in modern large-scale applications, it becomes necessary to account in some way for the subgrid variability of physiographic properties and their interactions with subgrid soil moisture dynamics in order to derive robust estimates of grid-scale land surface fluxes. Albertson and Montaldo [2003] present a conservation equation for subgrid soil moisture spatial variability, which includes production and destruction terms related to the various interactions between moisture fields and flux fields (i.e., infiltration, drainage, evapotranspiration, and horizontal redistribution). Here we present a rigorous closure of the conservation equations of the first and second moments of the soil moisture field (omitting topographic redistribution in this effort). Closed terms include correlation coefficients between soil moisture and physiographic properties. The approach presented here provides accounting for the effects of dynamic interaction between soil moisture spatial variability and the underlying soil texture and vegetation density fields. Closure is achieved in terms of the spatial mean soil moisture evolution, with closure coefficients being functions of the correlation coefficient between the underlying soil texture and vegetation density patterns (i.e., the physiographic setting). Making use of these relationships, the proposed approach uses known subgrid soil texture and vegetation density fields to accurately simulate the temporal trajectory of subgrid variance of soil moisture, which supports improved estimates of grid-scale land surface fluxes. The approach is tested synthetically (closure model versus distributed model) over a wide range of physiographic characteristics and meteorological conditions, with results demonstrating that the closure model based approach reproduces the temporal dynamics of the soil moisture variability and provides improved grid-scale land surface flux estimates. In fact, the second-order closure was shown to reduce the errors in integrated land surface flux estimates, as compared to those derived from zero-order approximation estimates, by an order of magnitude in certain conditions.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the contributions of climate change (CC) and human activities (HAs), which are important drivers of the hydrological cycle, to runoff change by CC and HAs under uncertainty is crucial for water resource management, especially in karst basins. In this study, we adopted the climate elasticity method to assess the impacts of CC and HAs on runoff change in Chengbi River Basin during 1970--2019. Furthermore, the main sources of uncertainty (Budyko formula, breakpoint, and underlying surface characteristics) in runoff change attribution were quantified via analysis of variance method. The improved innovative trend analysis based on the Fisher optimal partition method was first used for the non-monotonic trend analysis. The groundwater storage change obtained through the abcd model was used to obtain the effective precipitation for the Budyko hypothesis. The results indicated that the runoff and precipitation exhibited an increasing trend in wet and normal years, whereas they exhibited a decreasing trend in dry years after 1995 compared with 1970--1994. Furthermore, potential evapotranspiration exhibited no significant trend. The climate elasticity method based on the Budyko formula was effective, and the Choudhury-Yang formula was found to be more suitable than the Fu formula for the basin. The impact of water storage change was not negligible, and water storage change needs to be considered in runoff change attribution. Effective precipitation played a dominant role in runoff change, with a mean contribution rate of 87.85\%, whereas the mean contribution rates of potential evapotranspiration and underlying surface characteristics were 22.55\% and -10.40\%, respectively. The breakpoint was the main source of uncertainties in runoff change attribution and demonstrated the highest contribution to the uncertainties (85.93\%). The simultaneous breakpoint of the runoff coefficient was suggested as a reference to determine the confident breakpoint of runoff. The findings of this study are expected to provide a scientific basis for water resource management and contribute to the development of the climate elasticity method.},

A total of 256 soil samples from 21 different countries and 35 publications containing both textural (sand, silt and clay percentages) and Atterberg limits data have been analyzed. The soils were classified according to traditional particle size criteria using the USDA texture triangle. On the other hand, the Plasticity index / Liquid limit ratio, a parameter called clay factor (CF) in this research, was calculated and plotted against the percentage of sand to classify the soil according to the texture-plasticity system proposed by the authors in 2018. The evaluation through CF and comparison with the authors' proposal has shown the limitations of the USDA classification, which only determines soil texture in terms of particle size, but not how this texture affects actual soil properties, an aspect that could be very useful. It has been demonstrated that a significant percentage (20\%) of soils classified with the USDA system actually exhibit plastic behavior that is completely unrelated to the assigned name (e.g., non-plastic soils classified as clay). However, the fact that about 80\% of the classified soils with both systems present the same group designation ({$\sim$}37\%) or are adjacent groups ({$\sim$}43\%), shows that the authors' classification does not break sharply with the textural criteria accepted to date, which is positive if this new proposal is intended to be used as an alternative. Therefore, the proposed classification conciliates plastic and textural properties, allowing to classify the soil in a more accurate way, adjusting it to its real behavior.},

  abstract = {Global-scale assessments of freshwater fluxes and storages by hydrological models under historic climate conditions are subject to a variety of uncertainties. Using the global hydrological model WaterGAP (Water -- Global Assessment and Prognosis) 2.2, we investigated the sensitivity of simulated freshwater fluxes and water storage variations to five major sources of uncertainty: climate forcing, land cover input, model structure/refinements, consideration of human water use and calibration (or no calibration) against observed mean river discharge. In a modeling experiment, five variants of the standard version of WaterGAP 2.2 were generated that differed from the standard version only regarding the investigated source of uncertainty. The basin-specific calibration approach for WaterGAP was found to have the largest effect on grid cell fluxes as well as on global AET (actual evapotranspiration) and discharge into oceans for the period 1971--2000. Regarding grid cell fluxes, climate forcing ranks second before land cover input. Global water storage trends are most sensitive to model refinements (mainly modeling of groundwater depletion) and consideration of human water use. The best fit to observed time series of monthly river discharge or discharge seasonality is obtained with the standard WaterGAP 2.2 model version which is calibrated and driven by daily reanalysis-based WFD/WFDEI (combination of Watch Forcing Data based on ERA40 and Watch Forcing Data based on ERA-Interim) climate data. Discharge computed by a calibrated model version using monthly CRU TS (Climate Research Unit time-series) 3.2 and GPCC (Global Precipitation Climatology Center) v6 climate input reduced the fit to observed discharge for most stations. Taking into account uncertainties of climate and land cover data, global 1971--2000 discharge into oceans and inland sinks ranges between 40 000 and 42 000 km3 yr-1. Global actual evapotranspiration, with 70 000 km3 yr-1, is rather unaffected by climate and land cover uncertainties. Human water use reduced river discharge by 1000 km3 yr-1, such that global renewable water resources are estimated to range between 41 000 and 43 000 km3 yr-1. The climate data sets WFD (available until 2001) and WFDEI (starting in 1979) were found to be inconsistent with respect to shortwave radiation data, resulting in strongly different actual evapotranspiration. Global assessments of freshwater fluxes and storages would therefore benefit from the development of a global data set of consistent daily climate forcing from 1900 to present.},

After removing outliers, the first three principal components (PC) of the persistent yield anomalies are scrutinized to assess their association with climate and to identify co-varying countries and crops. Sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa), atmospheric and oceanic indices, air temperature anomalies (ATa) and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) are used to study the association between the PCs and climate. Results show that large-scale climate, especially El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are strongly correlated with crop yield variability. Extensive maize harvesting regions in Europe and North America, rice in South America, Oceania and east of Asia, sorghum in west and southeast of Asia, North America and Caribbean and soybean in North and South America, Oceania and south of Asia experienced the influence of local climate variability in this period. Sorghum yield variability across the globe exhibits significant correlations with many atmospheric and oceanic indices. Results indicate that not only do the same crops in many countries co-vary significantly, but different crops, in particular maize, in different PCs also co-vary with other crops. Identifying the association between climate and crop yield variability and recognizing similar and dissimilar countries in terms of yield fluctuations can be informative for the identified nations with regard to the periodic and predictable nature of many large-scale climatic patterns.},

The paper also explores utilization of the Ordinary Kriging (OK) method as a multi-model combination scheme for hydrological simulation/prediction. These techniques are compared against Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Weighted Average (WA) methods to demonstrate their effectiveness. The mentioned techniques are applied to the three monthly water balance models used to generate stream flow simulations for two mountainous basins in the South-West of Iran. For both basins, the results demonstrate that MBEM and FUCEP generate more skillful and reliable probabilistic predictions, outperforming all the other techniques. We have also found that OK did not demonstrate any improved skill as a simple combination method over WA scheme for neither of the basins.},

A water balance model was used in which variations of soil moisture, snow budget, deep infiltration and interactions with groundwater resources were modeled. Four various combinations of sub-catchment delineation, altitudinal discretization and division into square-shaped grids were tested for semi-distributed water balance modeling of a basin located in southwest of Iran, namely Roodzard Basin, with arid and semiarid climate based on Koppen-Geiger climate classification. The results showed improvement in the model performances when spatial variations of the meteorological data and topographic characteristics of the basin were incorporated in the modeling process. The effects of spatial scale resolution dependency were evaluated in projecting streamflow for various climate change scenarios. The results showed that finer resolution of grid cells in the semi-distributed model does not necessarily result in more accurate estimation of monthly streamflows and altitudinal discretization provides almost same accuracy as the results of grid-based models. Moreover, probability distribution of projections obtained from water balance models for A2 and B2 of Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) scenarios presented less coefficient of variation and skewness compared with historical observations.},

The future hydro-climatic regime and water availability of the Hunza basin (a sub-basin of UIB) were analysed using the newly released Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) climate projections. A data and parameter parsimonious precipitation-runoff model, the Distance Distribution Dynamics (DDD) model, was used with energy balance-based subroutines for snowmelt, glacier melt and evapotranspiration. The DDD model was set up for baseline (1991-2010), mid-century (2041-2060) and end-century (2081-2100) climates projections from two global circulation models (GCM), namely EC-Earth3 and MPI-ESM. The projections indicate a substantial increase in temperature (1.1-8.6 degrees C) and precipitation (12-32\%) throughout the twenty-first century. The simulations show the future flow increase between 23-126\% and the future glacier melt increase between 30-265\%, depending on the scenarios and GCMs used. Moreover, the simulations suggest an increasing glacier melt contribution from all elevations with a significant increase from the higher elevations. The findings provide a basis for planning and modifying reservoir operation strategies with respect to hydropower generation, irrigation withdrawals, flood control, and drought management.},

  abstract = {Accurate and reliable hydrologic simulations are important for many applications such as water resources management, future water availability projections and predictions of extreme events. However, the accuracy of water balance estimates is limited by the lack of large-scale observations, model simulation uncertainties and biases related to errors in model structure and uncertain inputs (e.g., hydrologic parameters and atmospheric forcings). The availability of long-term and global remotely sensed soil moisture offers the opportunity to improve model estimates through data assimilation with complete spatiotemporal coverage. In this study, we assimilated the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) derived soil moisture (SM) information to improve the estimation of continental-scale soil moisture and runoff. The assimilation experiment was conducted over a time period 2000--2006 with the Community Land Model, version 3.5 (CLM3.5), integrated with the Parallel Data Assimilation Framework (PDAF) at a spatial resolution of 0.0275{$\circ$} ({$\sim$}3\&thinsp;km) over Europe. The model was forced with the high-resolution reanalysis COSMO-REA6 from the Hans Ertel Centre for Weather Research (HErZ). The performance of assimilation was assessed against open-loop model simulations and cross-validated with independent ESA CCI-derived soil moisture (CCI-SM) and gridded runoff observations. Our results showed improved estimates of soil moisture, particularly in the summer and autumn seasons when cross-validated with independent CCI-SM observations. The assimilation experiment results also showed overall improvements in runoff, although some regions were degraded, especially in central Europe. The results demonstrated the potential of assimilating satellite soil moisture observations to produce downscaled and improved high-resolution soil moisture and runoff simulations at the continental scale, which is useful for water resources assessment and monitoring.},

Accurate and timely warnings are critical for mitigating flood risks2, but hydrological simulation models typically must be calibrated to long data records in each watershed. Here we show that artificial intelligence-based forecasting achieves reliability in predicting extreme riverine events in ungauged watersheds at up to a five-day lead time that is similar to or better than the reliability of nowcasts (zero-day lead time) from a current state-of-the-art global modelling system (the Copernicus Emergency Management Service Global Flood Awareness System). In addition, we achieve accuracies over five-year return period events that are similar to or better than current accuracies over one-year return period events. This means that artificial intelligence can provide flood warnings earlier and over larger and more impactful events in ungauged basins. The model developed here was incorporated into an operational early warning system that produces publicly available (free and open) forecasts in real time in over 80 countries. This work highlights a need for increasing the availability of hydrological data to continue to improve global access to reliable flood warnings.},

  abstract = {Abstract The concepts of model benchmarking, model agility, and large-sample hydrology are becoming more prevalent in hydrologic and land surface modeling. As modeling systems become more sophisticated, these concepts have the ability to help improve modeling capabilities and understanding. In this paper, their utility is demonstrated with an application of the physically based Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC). The authors implement VIC for a sample of 531 basins across the contiguous United States, incrementally increase model agility, and perform comparisons to a benchmark. The use of a large-sample set allows for statistically robust comparisons and subcategorization across hydroclimate conditions. Our benchmark is a calibrated, time-stepping, conceptual hydrologic model. This model is constrained by physical relationships such as the water balance, and it complements purely statistical benchmarks due to the increased physical realism and permits physically motivated benchmarking using metrics that relate one variable to another (e.g., runoff ratio). The authors find that increasing model agility along the parameter dimension, as measured by the number of model parameters available for calibration, does increase model performance for calibration and validation periods relative to less agile implementations. However, as agility increases, transferability decreases, even for a complex model such as VIC. The benchmark outperforms VIC in even the most agile case when evaluated across the entire basin set. However, VIC meets or exceeds benchmark performance in basins with high runoff ratios (greater than {\textasciitilde}0.8), highlighting the ability of large-sample comparative hydrology to identify hydroclimatic performance variations.},

  abstract = {A daily set of surface meteorological forcings, model-derived surface moisture fluxes, and state variables for global land areas for the period of 1979-93 is described. The forcing dataset facilitates global simulations and evaluation of land surface parameterizations without relying heavily on GCM output. Daily precipitation and temperature are based on station observations, daily wind speeds are based on National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis data, and the remaining meteorological forcing variables (shortwave radiation, longwave radiation, and vapor pressure) are derived from the precipitation and temperature series. The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land surface model is used to produce a set of derived fluxes and state variables, including snow water equivalent, evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture storage. The main differences between the new dataset and other, similar datasets are the daily time step, the use of a specified simulation period as opposed to climatological averages, the length of the simulation period, the use of observed meteorological data, and the use of a more realistic hydrological model. Comparison with observations and existing climatologies shows that 1) the interannual variation in simulated snow cover extent is similar to observations in Eurasia but is somewhat underpredicted in North America; 2) the components of the global and continental water balance are similar to those in previously produced climatologies, although runoff is somewhat lower; 3) patterns of simulated soil moisture storage are similar to the climatology of Mintz and Serafini, but the more sophisticated VIC hydrological model produces a larger range in soil moisture; and 4) the annual cycle and spatial patterns in soil moisture compare well with soil moisture observations in Illinois and in central Eurasia, but mean modeled soil moisture is somewhat lower than observed, and observed soil moisture shows a greater interannual persistence than do the simulations.},

  abstract = {The ability to simulate coupled energy and water fluxes over large continental river basins, in particular streamflow, was largely nonexistent a decade ago. Since then, macroscale hydrological models (MHMs) have been developed, which predict such fluxes at continental and subcontinental scales. Because the runoff formulation in MHMs must be parameterized because of the large spatial scale at which they are implemented, some calibration of model parameters is inevitably necessary. However, calibration is a time-consuming process and quickly becomes infeasible when the modeled area or the number of basins increases. A methodology for model parameter transfer is described that limits the number of basins requiring direct calibration. Parameters initially were estimated for nine large river basins. As a first attempt to transfer parameters, the global land area was grouped by climate zone, and model parameters were transferred within zones. The transferred parameters were then used to simulate the water balance in 17 other continental river basins. Although the parameter transfer approach did not reduce the bias and root-mean-square error (rmse) for each individual basin, in aggregate the transferred parameters reduced the relative (monthly) rmse from 121\% to 96\% and the mean bias from 41\% to 36\%. Subsequent direct calibration of all basins further reduced the relative rmse to an average of 70\% and the bias to 12\%. After transferring the parameters globally, the mean annual global runoff increased 9.4\% and evapotranspiration decreased by 5.0\% in comparison with an earlier global simulation using uncalibrated parameters. On a continental basis, the changes in runoff and evapotranspiration were much larger. A diagnosis of simulation errors for four basins with particularly poor results showed that most of the error was attributable to bias in the Global Precipitation Climatology Project precipitation products used to drive the MHM.},

VIC-2L is a hydrologically based soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer scheme designed to represent the land surface in numerical weather prediction and climate models. The grid network scheme allows streamflow to be predicted for large continental rivers. Off-line (observed and estimated surface meteorological and radiative forcings) applications of the model to the Columbia River (1 degrees latitude-longitude spatial resolution) and Delaware River (0.5 degrees resolution) are described. The model performed quite well in both applications, reproducing the seasonal hydrograph and annual flow volumes to within a few percent. Difficulties in reproducing observed streamflow in the arid portion of the Snake River basin are attributed to groundwater-surface water interactions, which are not modeled by VIC-2L.},

The assessment of these processes is also useful for water resource management and long-term sustainability of any hydrological project. In this study, an attempt is made to quantify the effects of climate change on streamflow and sediment concentration in the Purna river basin, India. Three Regional Circulation Models (RCMs) with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 for the four future periods of P1 (2009--2031), P2 (2032--2053), P3 (2054--2075) and P4 (2076--2099) are considered. Differences in scenarios are compared with the base period 1980--2005. The SWAT is used on monthly basis for the period 1980 to 2005 with calibration period 1980 to 1994 and validation period 1995 to 2005. The projected precipitation and temperature show a significant increasing trend compared to the baseline condition for both RCPs. Similarly, the average monthly streamflow is projected to increase by 24.47 to 115.94 m3/s whereas average monthly sediment concentration by 32.58 to 162.96 mg/l under RCP 4.5 and 8.5. In particular, streamflow and sediment are expected to increase significantly from June to September at the outlet of the basin. The study results give insight into future hydrological scenarios which will be useful for policy makers to implement effective water resource strategies.},

This study aims to employ both Grid-RCCC-WBM model and Fu's equation based on Budyko hypothesis to quantitatively analyze the spatial patterns of runoff changes, driving forces, and upstream--downstream relationships in ten typical basins across the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) for the first time. Breaks for Additive Season and Trend method was used to detect breakpoints in runoff series and both hydrological model and Budyko equation categorized driving forces of runoff change into change in climatic (including precipitation and potential evaporation) and underlying surface conditions. The results indicated (i) significant abrupt changes in the runoff time series around 1998, with runoff increasing in all basins except for the source region of the Yellow River. (ii) significant upstream--downstream differences in the trend and magnitude of runoff changes between breakpoints in the Yangtze and Lancang Rivers over the past 20~years, and (iii) significant runoff response to climate variability after the breakpoints in the source region of the Yangtze and Yellow river. Our findings revealed that, contrary to the backdrop of decreasing precipitation, the upstream basins maintained increasing runoff relying on permafrost and glacier meltwater, while the downstream basins exhibited decreasing trend. The differences in runoff changes after the detected breakpoints were dominated by changes in underlying surface conditions, with the highest contribution rates observed in the Dajin (494~\%), Lanzhou (398\%), and Tangnaihai (197\%) basins. This study involved both spatial pattern and upstream--downstream relationship of runoff change that can be widely applied to other large-scale regions and especially holds important implications for the scientific and rational utilization of water resources in the QTP.},

The results showed that: (1) the temperature of the western route will increase significantly in the NF and FF with an extent of 1.6 {\textopenbullet}C and 2.0 {\textopenbullet}C, respectively, (2) precipitation will very likely increase even though Global Climate Model (GCM) projections are quite dispersed and uncertain, and (3) over half of the GCMs projected that streamflow of receiving area will slightly increase with a rate of 1.68\% [-8.67\%, 12.3\%] and 2.78\% [-3.30\%, 11.0\%] in the NF and FF, respectively. Climate change will support the planning of the western route to a certain extent. However, water supply risk induced by the extreme situation of climate change should be paid adequate consideration when the project operates in practice due to the large dispersion and uncertainty of GCM projections.},

  abstract = {Vegetation, climate and topography have been empirically formulated into the controlling parameter of the Budyko model (omega) to estimate evapotranspiration (ET). However, these variables, if simultaneously employed, may induce multicollinearity problems because of their potential interactions. Further, these interactions may vary with different time scales and subsequently result in the inaccurate estimation of to omega. As such, we investigated the interactions of vegetation, climate and topography and their corresponding effects on ET modelling at different time scales by employing vegetation coverage (M), an improved climate seasonality and asynchrony index (SAI), the fraction of precipitation falling as snow (f(s)) and relative basin relief (BR/(B) over barR), in 30 catchments in China's Loess Plateau. We found that, on annual scale, M and SAI were significantly related to omega, while being independent from each other; in consequence, both of them should be parameterized into the Budyko model on the annual scale for better ET modelling. However, the links between M and SAI became stronger with increased time scales, the parameterization of omega should thus be reformatted for longer periods. When extended to a 30-year period, omega was closely related to the above variables, but M was highly inter correlated with SAI and BR/(B) over barR, and f(s) was significantly related to BR/(B) over barR. The independent M and f(s) were finally selected to fit omega, which allowed mean annual ET to be accurately modelled on long-term scale. Identification of the dominant factors applicable at different time scales can simplify the empirical parameterization of the Budyko formula and thereby facilitate more accurate estimation of ET.},

This study proposed a practical framework for assessing water resource response to the context of climate changes in alpine catchments from the respective of both runoff and hydroclimatic conditions. Utilizing Grid-RCCC-WBM driven by corrected climatic forcing from the global climate models, this study estimate the prospective overall warmer and wetter pattern in the source region of Yangtze River. The key results indicated that: (1) Under all future scenarios, both temperature and precipitation within the catchment exhibit a significant upward trend. Projections from multi-model ensembles (MME) suggest that during the mid-term period (2041--2060, MT), temperatures are expected to rise by [0.74~{$^\circ$}C, 3.08~{$^\circ$}C] compared to the baseline period (1995--2014), with precipitation changes ranging from [4.8\%, 21.4\%]. (2) Future runoff within the catchment exhibits a consistent increase, with a linear trend rate of 1.1~mm/decade. runoff changes in MT compared to the baseline period vary from [-5.1\%, 33.7\%]. Runoff decreases in the northern part of the catchment, while notable increases occur in the southeastern and western regions. (3) In the future, the ratio of catchment evaporation capacity to precipitation decreases in comparison to the baseline period with an augmentation in soil moisture, enhancing its capacity for water retention and reducing the conversion of precipitation to evaporation, resulting a wetting trend of the catchment. (4) The future snowpack in the catchment continues to decrease, with a significant reduction in both the proportion of snowfall relative to total precipitation and the proportion of snowmelt runoff relative to total runoff, the risk of water resources crisis in the watershed is escalating.},

In this study, the Budyko method was used to quantitatively identify the effects of climate conditions and the underlying surface such as topography, land use and vegetation cover on the runoff changes in the Yellow River Basin during 1961-2018, and to clarify the spatial differences in the sensitivity and attribution of the runoff evolution by dividing the entire basin into sub-basins. The results show that the runoff was more sensitive to the underlying surface and precipitation changes than to the potential evapo-ration. The sensitivity coefficients decreased from upstream to downstream and the aridity index increased. The contribution rates of the climatic and the underlying surface changes to the runoff changes were 10.3-36.8\% and 62.9-88.7\%, respectively, and the underlying surface changes were the dominant factor causing the decrease in the runoff. Climate change led to increased runoff in the upper reaches and decreased runoff in the middle and lower reaches; while the underlying surface changes led to decreased runoff throughout the entire basin, especially in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. The quantified spatial differences in the runoff evolution attribution can help improve regional water resource management and provide theoretical support for studying the water cycle evolution mechanism in the Yellow River Basin.},

Disentangling the impact of these two drivers on ecosystem carbon and water cycling is difficult because they are often correlated, and experimental tools for manipulating atmospheric demand in the field are lacking. Consequently, the role of atmospheric demand is often not adequately factored into experiments or represented in models(5-7). Here we show that atmospheric demand limits surface conductance and evapotranspiration to a greater extent than soil moisture in many biomes, including mesic forests that are of particular importance to the terrestrial carbon sink(8,9). Further, using projections from ten general circulation models, we show that climate change will increase the importance of atmospheric constraints to carbon and water fluxes in all ecosystems. Consequently, atmospheric demand will become increasingly important for vegetation function, accounting for {$>$}70\% of growing season limitation to surface conductance in mesic temperate forests. Our results suggest that failure to consider the limiting role of atmospheric demand in experimental designs, simulation models and land management strategies will lead to incorrect projections of ecosystem responses to future climate conditions.},

  abstract = {Modelling the impact of climate change on streamflow for remote or data sparse regions is a challenge for hydrologists, as large datasets are often needed to adequately characterise the processes that dominate. The Tibetan Plateau, which forms the headwaters of the Brahmaputra and many other major rivers in the Indo-China region, is not closely monitored due to its harsh environment. This lack of monitoring is significant as regards its substantial snow resources, of considerable importance given the influence these have on the supply of water to downstream communities. This research uses a conceptual hydrologic model developed to simulate the impact of the changing climate in such large, snow-covered, data sparse catchments, to adequately understand the likely changes in future water availability in the highly populated Brahmaputra basin and surrounding areas in the Tibetan Plateau. A multivariate nested recursive bias correction (MRNBC) approach is used for correcting systematic biases present in the climate model simulations of temperature and precipitation jointly across multiple timescales preserving the dynamic relationships amongst the variables. The results disclose that monthly snow cover fraction in the near future (2041-2060) and far future (2071-2090) will decrease significantly with respect to the historical period (1981-2000). While the annual streamflow is noted to be increasing for the basin, water supply reliability exhibits a reduction, partly as a result of the increased spill volume arising from greater snowmelt concentrated over the wet period, and partly the increase in evaporation losses due to higher temperatures. While the above results pertain to the Brahmaputra basin, similar changes are expected for the other major rivers that originate in the Tibetan Plateau.},

  abstract = {Changes in land use and land cover are major drivers of hydrological alteration in the tropical Andes. However, quantifying their impacts is fraught with difficulties because of the extreme diversity in meteorological boundary conditions, which contrasts strongly with the lack of knowledge about local hydrological processes. Although local studies have reduced data scarcity in certain regions, the complexity of the tropical Andes poses a big challenge to regional hydrological prediction. This study analyses data generated from a participatory monitoring network of 25 headwater catchments covering three of the major Andean biomes (paramo, jalca and puna) and links their hydrological responses to main types of human interventions (cultivation, afforestation and grazing). A paired catchment setup was implemented to evaluate the impacts of change using a 'trading space-for-time' approach. Catchments were selected based on regional representativeness and contrasting land use types. Precipitation and discharge have been monitored and analysed at high temporal resolution for a time period between 1 and 5 years. The observed catchment responses clearly reflect the extraordinarily wide spectrum of hydrological processes of the tropical Andes. They range from perennially humid paramos in Ecuador and northern Peru with extremely large specific discharge and baseflows, to highly seasonal, flashy catchments in the drier punas of southern Peru and Bolivia. The impacts of land use are similarly diverse and their magnitudes are a function of catchment properties, original and replacement vegetation and management type. Cultivation and afforestation consistently affect the entire range of discharges, particularly low flows. The impacts of grazing are more variable but have the largest effect on the catchment hydrological regulation. Overall, anthropogenic interventions result in increased streamflow variability and significant reductions in catchment regulation capacity and water yield, irrespective of the hydrological properties of the original biome.

  abstract = {This study investigates possible impacts of four global warming levels (GWLs: GWL1.5, GWL2.0, GWL2.5, and GWL3.0) on drought characteristics over Niger River basin (NRB) and Volta River basin (VRB). Two drought indices---Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized PrecipitationEvapotranspiration Index (SPEI)---were employed in characterizing droughts in 20 multi-model simulation outputs from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX). The performance of the simulation in reproducing basic hydro-climatological features and severe drought characteristics (i.e., magnitude and frequency) in the basins were evaluated. The projected changes in the future drought frequency were quantified and compared under the four GWLs for two climate forcing scenarios (RCP8.5 and RCP4.5). The regional climate model (RCM) ensemble gives a realistic simulation of historical hydro-climatological variables needed to calculate the drought indices. With SPEI, the simulation ensemble projects an increase in the magnitude and frequency of severe droughts over both basins (NRB and VRB) at all GWLs, but the increase, which grows with the GWLs, is higher over NRB than over VRB. More than 75\% of the simulations agree on the projected increase at GWL1.5 and all simulations agree on the increase at higher GWLs. With SPI, the projected changes in severe drought is weaker and the magnitude remains the same at all GWLs, suggesting that SPI projection may underestimate impacts of the GWLs on the intensity and severity of future drought. The results of this study have application in mitigating impact of global warming on future drought risk over the regional water systems.},

The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modeling, and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2 degrees C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with the climate model simulations run within the 2017-2018 time frame, and output from the climate model projections made available and analyses performed over the 2018-2020 period.},

  abstract = {In recent decades considerable progress has been made in climate model development. Following the massive increase in computational power, models became more sophisticated. At the same time also simple conceptual models have advanced. In this study we validate and compare three hydrological models of different complexity to investigate whether their performance varies accordingly. For this purpose we use runoff and also soil moisture measurements, which allow a truly independent validation, from several sites across Switzerland. The models are calibrated in similar ways with the same runoff data. Our results show that the more complex models HBV and PREVAH outperform the simple water balance model (SWBM) in case of runoff but not for soil moisture. Furthermore the most sophisticated PREVAH model shows an added value compared to the HBV model only in case of soil moisture. Focusing on extreme events we find generally improved performance of the SWBM during drought conditions and degraded agreement with observations during wet extremes. For the more complex models we find the opposite behavior, probably because they were primarily developed for prediction of runoff extremes. As expected given their complexity, HBV and PREVAH have more problems with over-fitting. All models show a tendency towards better performance in lower altitudes as opposed to (pre-) alpine sites. The results vary considerably across the investigated sites. In contrast, the different metrics we consider to estimate the agreement between models and observations lead to similar conclusions, indicating that the performance of the considered models is similar at different time scales as well as for anomalies and long-term means. We conclude that added complexity does not necessarily lead to improved performance of hydrological models, and that performance can vary greatly depending on the considered hydrological variable (e.g. runoff vs. soil moisture) or hydrological conditions (floods vs. droughts).},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the single and combined impacts of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) on precipitation and streamflow in China over the last century. Results indicate that the precipitation and streamflow overall decrease during El Nino/PDO warm phase periods and increase during La Nina/PDO cool phase periods in the majority of China, although there are regional and seasonal differences. Precipitation and streamflow in the Yellow River basin, Yangtze River basin and Pearl River basin are more significantly influenced by El Nino and La Nina events than is precipitation and streamflow in the Songhua River basin, especially in October and November. Moreover, significant influence of ENSO on streamflow in the Yangtze River mainly occurs in summer and autumn while in the Pearl River influence primarily occurs in the winter and spring. The precipitation and streamflow are relatively greater in the warm PDO phase in the Songhua River basin and several parts of the Yellow River basin and relatively less in the Pearl River basin and most parts of Northwest China compared to those in the cool PDO phase, though there is little significance detected by Wilcoxon signed-rank test. When considering the combined influence of ENSO and PDO, the responses of precipitation/streamflow are shown to be opposite in northern China and southern China, with ENSO-related precipitation/streamflow enhanced in northern China and decreased in southern China during the warm PDO phases, and enhanced in southern China and decreased in northern China during the cool PDO phases. It is hoped that this study will be beneficial for understanding the precipitation/streamflow responses to the changing climate and will correspondingly provide valuable reference for water resources prediction and management across China.},

  abstract = {The long-term surface water balance over land is described by the partitioning of precipitation (P) into runoff and evapotranspiration (ET), and is commonly characterized by the ratio ET/P. The ratio between potential evapotranspiration (PET) and P is explicitly considered to be the primary control of ET/P within the Budyko framework, whereas all other controls are often integrated into a single parameter, . Although the joint effect of these additional controlling factors of ET/P can be significant, a detailed understanding of them is yet to be achieved. This study therefore introduces a new global data set for the long-term mean partitioning of P into ET and runoff in 2,733 catchments, which is based on in situ observations and assembled from a systematic examination of peer-reviewed studies. A total of 26 controls of ET/P that are proposed in the literature are assessed using the new data set. Results reveal that: (i) factors controlling ET/P vary between regions with different climate types; (ii) controls other than PET/P explain at least 35\% of the ET/P variance in all regions, and up to approximate to 90\% in arid climates; (iii) among these, climate factors and catchment slope dominate over other landscape characteristics; and (iv) despite the high attention that vegetation-related indices receive as controls of ET/P, they are found to play a minor and often nonsignificant role. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive picture on factors controlling the partitioning of P, with valuable insights for model development, watershed management, and the assessment of water resources around the globe. Plain Language Summary Precipitation over long time periods (several years or longer) is partitioned into water leaving a river catchment as runoff, and water that is evaporated or transpired by plants. Different factors have been suggested to directly and indirectly influence how much of the precipitation turns into runoff, and how much is evaporated or transpired. To further assess the relevance of these factors, we gathered observational information about the water balance from numerous previous studies, obtaining a dataset with unprecedented global coverage. Results reveal a similar importance of long-term average evaporative demand (the amount of water that would evaporate under conditions of sufficient water supply) relative to precipitation, and the net effect of all other influencing factors. Among these additional factors we find that the average slope of a catchment and climate-related variables, such as the fraction of precipitation falling as snow and the relative timing of rainfall and evaporative demand during the year, influence the partitioning of precipitation more than other landscape characteristics. Surprisingly, vegetation-related factors are found to play a minor role despite the high attention they have previously received. Overall this study provides valuable insights on processes controlling freshwater resources globally.},

Results indicate that the multi-model ensemble (MME) of CMIP6 overall has lower relative bias and root-mean square error of both annual and seasonal mean than that of CMIP5, except for winter, but both of the two ensembles show the best projected accuracy in winter. Generally, CMIP6 outperformed CMIP5 in capturing spatial and temporal pattern over the YRB, especially in the midstream and downstream areas, which have high precipitation. Further analyses suggest that the CMIP6 GCMs have lower median normalized root-mean square error than CMIP5 GCMs. Based on the Taylor skill (TS) score, both CMIP6 and CMIP5 GCMs are ranked to evaluate relative model performance. CMIP6 GCMs have higher ranks than CMIP5 GCMs, with an average TS score of 0.68 (0.55) for CMIP6 (CMIP5), and three out of the five highest scored GCMs are CMIP6 GCMs. However, the CMIP6 precipitation projections are still quite uncertain, thus requiring further assessment and correction.},

  abstract = {Climatic changes have altered hydrological and climatic parameters worldwide, and climate projections suggest that such alterations will continue. In order to maintain the sustainable development and acquire the knowledge of water availability, climatic projection must be coupled with hydrological models. In this study, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models output were integrated with a calibrated hydrological model, Soil and Water Assessment Tools (SWAT) to evaluate the potential effect of climate change on green and blue water over Upper Narmada river Basin (UNB). Therefore, top three representative climate models (MIROC5, CNRM-CM5 and MPI-ESM-LR) from 24 CMIP5 climate models were selected for hydrological modelling. Selected representative climate model outputs were bias corrected by distribution mapping to remove systematic bias correction. Multi-site model calibration approaches indicated Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and Coefficient of Determination (R2) as 0.77 and 0.76 for calibration (1978--1995), and 0.73 and 0.70 for validation (1996--2005), respectively. Calibrated model was run for baseline period (1970--2000) and three futuristic period P1 (2011--2040), P2 (2041--2070) and P3 (2071--2100) under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Results indicated annual precipitation decreasing under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios changes in green and blue water varying from 16.22 to -14.10\% (CNRM,P3) under RCP4.5 and from 38.25 to -22.57\% under RCP8.5 with reference to baseline scenario. This study established the sensitivity of UNB to future climatic changes employing projections from CMIP5 climate models and exhibited an approach that applied multiple climate model outputs to estimate potential change over the river basin.},

  abstract = {Chamelia (catchment area = 1603 km2 ), a tributary of Mahakali, is a snow-fed watershed in Western Nepal. The watershed has 14 hydropower projects at various stages of development. This study simulated the current and future hydrological system of Chamelia using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The model was calibrated for 2001--2007; validated for 2008--2013; and then applied to assess streamflow response to projected future climate scenarios. Multi-site calibration ensures that the model is capable of reproducing hydrological heterogeneity within the watershed. Current water balance above the Q120 hydrological station in the forms of precipitation, actual evapotranspiration (AET), and net water yield are 2469 mm, 381 mm and 1946 mm, respectively. Outputs of five Regional Climate Models (RCMs) under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for three future periods were considered for assessing climate change impacts. An ensemble of bias-corrected RCM projections showed that maximum temperature under RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) scenario for near-, mid-, and far-futures is projected to increase from the baseline by 0.9 {$^\circ$}C (1.1 {$^\circ$}C), 1.4 {$^\circ$}C (2.1 {$^\circ$}C), and 1.6 {$^\circ$}C (3.4 {$^\circ$}C), respectively. Minimum temperature for the same scenarios and future periods are projected to increase by 0.9 {$^\circ$}C (1.2 {$^\circ$}C), 1.6 {$^\circ$}C (2.5 {$^\circ$}C), and 2.0 {$^\circ$}C (3.9 {$^\circ$}C), respectively. Average annual precipitation under RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) scenario for near-, mid-, and far-futures are projected to increase by 10\% (11\%), 10\% (15\%), and 13\% (15\%), respectively. Based on the five RCMs considered, there is a high consensus for increase in temperature but higher uncertainty with respect to precipitations. Under these projected changes, average annual streamflow was simulated to increase gradually from the near to far future under both RCPs; for instance, by 8.2\% in near-, 12.2\% in mid-, and 15.0\% in far-future under RCP4.5 scenarios. The results are useful for planning water infrastructure projects, in Chamelia and throughout the Mahakali basin, to ensure long-term sustainability under climate change.},

Physical laws translate increasing atmospheric heat into increasing atmospheric water content that drives precipitation changes. Within the literature, general agreement is that extreme precipitation is changing, yet different assessment methods, data sets, and study periods may result in different patterns and rates of change. Here we perform a global analysis of 8,730 daily precipitation records focusing on the 1964-2013 period when the global warming accelerates. We introduce a novel analysis of the N largest extremes in records having N complete years within the study period. Based on these extremes, which represent more accurately heavy precipitation than annual maxima, we form time series of their annual frequency and mean annual magnitude. The analysis offers new insights and reveals (1) global and zonal increasing trends in the frequency of extremes that are highly unlikely under the assumption of stationarity and (2) magnitude changes that are not as evident. Frequency changes reveal a coherent spatial pattern with increasing trends being detected in large parts of Eurasia, North Australia, and the Midwestern United States. Globally, over the last decade of the studied period we find 7\% more extreme events than the expected number. Finally, we report that changes in magnitude are not in general correlated with changes in frequency.},

We calibrate 11 parameters of a semi-distributed conceptual rainfall-runoff model to daily runoff and snow cover data of 320 Austrian catchments in the period 1987-1997 and verify the model for the period 1976-1986. We evaluate the predictive accuracy of the regionalisation methods by Jack-knife cross-validation against daily runoff and snow cover data. The results indicate that two methods perform best. The first is a kriging approach where the model parameters are regionalised independently from each other based on their spatial correlation. The second is a similarity approach where the complete set of model parameters is transposed from a donor catchment that is most similar in terms of its physiographic attributes (mean catchment elevation, stream network density, lake index, a real proportion of porous aquifers, land use, soils and geology). For the calibration period, the median Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency ME of daily runoff is 0.67 for both methods as compared to ME=0.72 for the at-site simulations. For the verification period, the corresponding efficiencies are 0.62 and 0.66. All regionalisation methods perform similar in terms of simulating snow cover.},

Here we have produced a new global map of climate using the K{\"o}ppen-Geiger system based on a large global data set of long-term monthly precipitation and temperature station time series. Climatic variables used in the K{\"o}ppen-Geiger system were calculated at each station and interpolated between stations using a two-dimensional (latitude and longitude) thin-plate spline with tension onto a 0.1\&deg;\&times;0.1\&deg; grid for each continent. We discuss some problems in dealing with sites that are not uniquely classified into one climate type by the K{\"o}ppen-Geiger system and assess the outcomes on a continent by continent basis. Globally the most common climate type by land area is BWh (14.2\%, Hot desert) followed by Aw (11.5\%, Tropical savannah).

  abstract = {The location and persistence of surface water (inland and coastal) is both affected by climate and human activity(1) and affects climate(2,3), biological diversity(4) and human wellbeing(5,6). Global data sets documenting surface water location and seasonality have been produced from inventories and national descriptions(7), statistical extrapolation of regional data(8) and satellite imagery(9-12), but measuring long-term changes at high resolution remains a challenge. Here, using three million Landsat satellite images(13), we quantify changes in global surface water over the past 32 years at 30-metre resolution. We record the months and years when water was present, where occurrence changed and what form changes took in terms of seasonality and persistence. Between 1984 and 2015 permanent surface water has disappeared from an area of almost 90,000 square kilometres, roughly equivalent to that of Lake Superior, though new permanent bodies of surface water covering 184,000 square kilometres have formed elsewhere. All continental regions show a net increase in permanent water, except Oceania, which has a fractional (one per cent) net loss. Much of the increase is from reservoir filling, although climate change(14) is also implicated. Loss is more geographically concentrated than gain. Over 70 per cent of global net permanent water loss occurred in the Middle East and Central Asia, linked to drought and human actions including river diversion or damming and unregulated withdrawal(15,16). Losses in Australia(17) and the USA(18) linked to long-term droughts are also evident. This globally consistent, validated data set shows that impacts of climate change and climate oscillations on surface water occurrence can be measured and that evidence can be gathered to show how surface water is altered by human activities. We anticipate that this freely available data will improve the modelling of surface forcing, provide evidence of state and change in wetland ecotones (the transition areas between biomes), and inform water-management decision-making.},

  abstract = {Streamflow regimes are rapidly changing in many regions of the world. Attribution of these changes to specific hydrological processes and their underlying climatic and anthropogenic drivers is essential to formulate an effective water policy. Traditional approaches to hydrologic attribution rely on the ability to infer hydrological processes through the development of catchment-scale hydrological models. However, such approaches are challenging to implement in practice due to limitations in using models to accurately associate changes in observed outcomes with corresponding drivers. Here we present an alternative approach that leverages the method of multiple hypotheses to attribute changes in streamflow in the Upper Jhelum watershed, an important tributary headwater region of the Indus basin, where a dramatic decline in streamflow since 2000 has yet to be adequately attributed to its corresponding drivers. We generate and empirically evaluate a series of alternative and complementary hypotheses concerning distinct components of the water balance. This process allows a holistic understanding of watershed-scale processes to be developed, even though the catchment-scale water balance remains open. Using remote sensing and secondary data, we explore changes in climate, surface water, and groundwater. The evidence reveals that climate, rather than land use, had a considerably stronger influence on reductions in streamflow, both through reduced precipitation and increased evapotranspiration. Baseflow analyses suggest different mechanisms affecting streamflow decline in upstream and downstream regions, respectively. These findings offer promising avenues for future research in the Upper Jhelum watershed, and an alternative approach to hydrological attribution in data-scarce regions.},

Elevation-dependent warming (EDW) can accelerate the rate of change in mountain ecosystems, cryospheric systems, hydrological regimes and biodiversity. Here we review important mechanisms that contribute towards EDW: snow albedo and surface-based feedbacks; water vapour changes and latent heat release; surface water vapour and radiative flux changes; surface heat loss and temperature change; and aerosols. All lead to enhanced warming with elevation (or at a critical elevation), and it is believed that combinations of these mechanisms may account for contrasting regional patterns of EDW. We discuss future needs to increase knowledge of mountain temperature trends and their controlling mechanisms through improved observations, satellite-based remote sensing and model simulations.},

However, most freshwater assessments focus on single hydroclimatic indicators (e.g., runoff, precipitation, or aridity), lacking analysis on combined changes in evaporative demand, and water availability on land. There remains a high degree of uncertainty over water implications at the basin scale, in particular for the most water-consuming sector-food production. Using the Budyko framework, we perform an assessment of future hydroclimatic change for the 50 largest African basins, finding a consistent pattern of change in four distinct regions across the two main emission scenarios corresponding to the Paris Agreement, and the business as usual. Although the Paris Agreement is likely to lead to less intense changes when compared to the business as usual, both scenarios show the same pattern of hydroclimatic shifts, suggesting a potential roadmap for hydroclimatic adaptation. We discuss the social-ecological implications of the projected hydroclimatic shifts in the four regions and argue that climate policies need to be complemented by soil and water conservation practices to make the best use of future water resources.},

  abstract = {Although many potential evapotranspiration (PET) formulas are available, there is still a lack of knowledge on when and where to use them in catchment modeling world-wide. Here we experimented with three different formulas in a global hydrological model (the World-wide HYPE), using 15 years of observations from 5,338 streamflow gauges and global evapotranspiration from Earth-observations (MOD16). We tested model performance in a multi-process approach to select the best formula for catchments covering the global landmass. From comparing the results with land-cover, climate classification, water-energy limitations, we found that climate is the main driver behind the spatial patterns in model performance. Hargreaves was the best PET formula in 50\% of the catchments, most of them located in the Amazonas, central Europe, and Oceania; Jensen-Haise was better for catchments in northern latitudes (36\%). Finally, Priestley-Taylor was the best formula for India and latitudes above 65{$^\circ$} North. The selection of a PET formula seems to be more critical in tropical regions close to the equator, where the differences in performance are above 50\%. This is also where PET is highest. We found a strong connection between the five main K{\"o}ppen regions and the PET formulas, further supported by landcover analysis. Hence, the PET formulas differed in their capacity to provide useful input to the water balance modeling, with complex formulas only giving improved predictions in temperate and polar regions; however, for the rest of the globe simpler formulas were better. We thus recommend to apply different PET formulas based on climatic regions world-wide.},

  abstract = {A conceptual model of a catchment's annual water balance is developed. The model is based on the sequential separation of annual precipitation into surface runoff and wetting, and wetting into baseflow and vaporization. The separation is based on a proportional relation linking the three variables involved at each step. The generic form of the proportional relation is (X - lambda Z(p) - Y)/[(1 - lambda)Z(p)] = Y/(X - lambda Z(p)), in which X is an independent variable, Y is a dependent variable, X is the initial abstraction coefficient, and Z(p) is the potential value of the difference Z = X - Y. Given a set of model parameters, the method can be used to separate annual precipitation into its three major components: surface runoff, baseflow, and vaporization. Initial application of the method to literature catchment data provided encouraging results. The method can be used for estimates of the annual water yield throughout the climatic spectrum. The model parameters can be estimated from past experience or calibrated using measured data.},

  abstract = {Human actions compromise the many life-supporting functions provided by the freshwater cycle. Yet, scientific understanding of anthropogenic freshwater change and its long-term evolution is limited. Here, using a multi-model ensemble of global hydrological models, we estimate how, over a 145-year industrial period (1861--2005), streamflow and soil moisture have deviated from pre-industrial baseline conditions (defined by 5th--95th percentiles, at 0.5{$^\circ$} grid level and monthly timestep over 1661--1860). Comparing the two periods, we find an increased frequency of local deviations on {\textasciitilde}45\% of land area, mainly in regions under heavy direct or indirect human pressures. To estimate humanity's aggregate impact on these two important elements of the freshwater cycle, we present the evolution of deviation occurrence at regional to global scales. Annually, local streamflow and soil moisture deviations now occur on 18.2\% and 15.8\% of global land area, respectively, which is 8.0 and 4.7 percentage points beyond the {\textasciitilde}3 percentage point wide pre-industrial variability envelope. Our results signify a substantial shift from pre-industrial streamflow and soil moisture reference conditions to persistently increasing change. This indicates a transgression of the new planetary boundary for freshwater change, which is defined and quantified using our approach, calling for urgent actions to reduce human disturbance of the freshwater cycle.},

For instance, previous studies have largely overlooked the potential impacts of El Ni{\~n}o on terrestrial moisture recycling (TMR). We perform a 40-year forward tracking simulation to derive a global climatology of recycled precipitation and use a composite analysis to investigate how El Ni{\~n}o affects TMR. We identify seven regions where the El Ni{\~n}o impact on TMR is most significant and find that, in these regions, changes in precipitation and TMR are directly related: they increase or decrease together. In addition, we find a marked latitudinal contrast between the Southern Hemisphere, where TMR increases during El Ni{\~n}o, and the Northern Hemisphere and the tropics, where it decreases. Our results indicate that the weakening and strengthening of TMR can be behind precipitation changes caused by El Ni{\~n}o globally.},

While mean state and variability changes have been studied separately, much less is known about their combined impact or relative importance. Additionally, studies of projected changes in ENSO have tended to focus on changes in, or adjacent to, the Pacific. Here we examine projected changes in climatic conditions during El Ni{\~n}o years and in ENSO-driven precipitation variability in 36 CMIP5 models. The models are forced according to the RCP8.5 scenario in which there are large, unmitigated increases in greenhouse gas concentrations during the twenty-first century. We examine changes over much of the globe, including 25 widely spread regions defined in the IPCC special report Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX). We confirm that precipitation variability associated with ENSO is projected to increase in the tropical Pacific, consistent with earlier research. We also find that the enhanced tropical Pacific variability drives ENSO-related variability increases in 19 SREX regions during DJF and in 18 during JJA. This externally forced increase in ENSO-driven precipitation variability around the world is on the order of 15\%--20\%. An increase of this size, although substantial, is easily masked at the regional level by internally generated multidecadal variability in individual runs. The projected changes in El Ni{\~n}o--driven precipitation variability are typically much smaller than projected changes in both mean state and ENSO neutral conditions in nearly all regions.},

  abstract = {The South-to-North Water Diversion project (SNWD project) is a mega water project designed to help solve water shortages in North China. The project's management and operation are highly influenced by runoff change induced by climate change in the water source areas. It is important to understand water availability from the source areas in the context of global warming to optimize the project's regulation. Based on the projections of nine GCMs, the future runoff in the water source areas of the three diversion routes was simulated by using a grid-based model RCCC-WBM (Water Balance Model developed by Research Center for Climate Change). Results show that temperature will rise by about 1.5{$^\circ$}C in the near future (2035, defined as 2026--2045) and 2.0{$^\circ$}C in the far future (2050, defined as 2041--2060) relative to the baseline period of 1956--2000. Although GCM projections of precipitation are highly uncertain, the projected precipitation will likely increase for all three water source areas. As a result of climate change, the simulated runoff in the water source areas of the SNWD project will likely increase slightly by less than 3\% relative to the baseline period for the near and far future. However, due to the large dispersion and uncertainty of GCM projections, a high degree of attention should be paid to the climate-induced risk of water supply under extreme situations, particularly for the middle route of the SNWD project.},

Climate change threatens to disturb this balance by altering the fraction of precipitation falling as snow and the timing of snowmelt, which may have profound effects on food production in basins where irrigated agriculture relies heavily on snowmelt runoff. Here, we analyse global patterns of snowmelt and agricultural water uses to identify regions and crops that are most dependent on snowmelt water resources. We find hotspots primarily in high-mountain Asia (the Tibetan Plateau), Central Asia, western Russia, western US and the southern Andes. Using projections of sub-annual runoff under warming scenarios, we identify the basins most at risk from changing snowmelt patterns, where up to 40\% of irrigation demand must be met by new alternative water supplies under a 4 degrees C warming scenario. Our results highlight basins and crops where adaptation of water management and agricultural systems may be especially critical in a changing climate. Snowmelt runoff is an important source of water for irrigating agricultural crops in high-mountain Asia, Central Asia, western Russia, western US and the southern Andes. Climate change places water resources in these basins at risk, indicating the need to adapt water management.},

In recent decades, especially since 2000, the TP has been experiencing a more rapid warming than its surrounding regions. This study uses Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) monthly averaged land surface temperature (LST) product to detect the recent warming trend with respect to elevations over the entire TP, because the number of weather stations from China Meteorological Administration (CMA) is rather limited in the western TP and, furthermore, are unavailable for areas higher than 4,800 m above sea level (ASL). The trend of MODIS LST is first validated against the warming trend estimated from near-surface air temperatures measured at CMA stations and the warming rate dependence on elevation is then derived from MODIS LST. The results indicate that the warming rate increases from 3,000 to 4,800 m ASL, and then becomes quite stable with a slight decline near the highest elevations. This altitudinal dependence of the warming rate has a significant implication for TP water resources and environmental changes, since most glaciers and snow surfaces are located above 5,000 m ASL over the TP.},

Although there were many regional studies, there is no clear conclusion on the best-performing regionalization method for global hydrological modelling. The objective of this study is to determine an appropriate global-scale regionalization scheme (GSRS) for global hydrological modelling. To this end, the performance of five regionalization methods with two different average options, two weighting approaches, and seven efficiency thresholds (i.e. Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) values to measure hydrological model performances) was compared over thousands of catchments based on four conceptual hydrological models. Results of nine global models from the Global Earth Observation for Integrated Water Resource Assessment (EartH2Observe) project were selected to validate the accuracy of GSRS in estimating global runoff. The results show that: (1) Spatial proximity method with the Inverse Distance Weighting method and the output average option offers the best regionalization result when using the KGE {$>$}= 0.5 as an efficiency threshold for all four hydrological models, (2) the regionalization-based global hydrological simulation schemes (RGHSs), i.e. the proposed GSRS combining with four hydrological models, consistently performs better than the nine global models from EartH2Observe project in the estimation of runoff for most catchments, with varying degrees of improvement in the median, upper and lower quartiles, and whiskers of each performance metric, and (3) the global long-term annual water resources estimated by RGHSs range between 42,592 and 46,810 km(3)/yr.},

There are a considerable number of forecasting models and techniques that have been employed in streamflow forecasting and gained importance in hydrological studies in recent decades. In this study, the main objective was to compare the accuracy of four data-driven techniques of Linear Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network in daily streamflow forecasting. For this purpose, three scenarios were defined based on historical precipitation and streamflow series for 26~years of the Kentucky River basin located in eastern Kentucky, US. Statistical criteria including the coefficient of correlation (\$\$R\$\$), Nash-Sutcliff coefficient of efficiency (\$\$E\$\$), Nash-Sutcliff for High flow (\$\$\{E\}\_\{H\}\$\$), Nash-Sutcliff for Low flow (\$\$\{E\}\_\{L\}\$\$), normalized root mean square error (\$\$NRMSE\$\$), relative error in estimating maximum flow (\$\$REmax\$\$), threshold statistics (\$\$TS\$\$), and average absolute relative error (\$\$AARE\$\$) were employed to compare the performances of these methods. The results show that the LSTM network outperforms the other models in forecasting daily streamflow with the lowest values of \$\$NRMSE\$\$and the highest values of\$\$\{E\}\_\{H\}\$\$,\$\$\{E\}\_\{L\}\$\$, and \$\$R\$\$under all scenarios. These findings indicated that the LSTM is a robust data-driven technique to characterize the time series behaviors in hydrological modeling applications.},

  abstract = {Across the UK, water abstracted from ground, surface, and tidal stores is regulated through a system of licenses to protect both the sources and the environment. Similar permits are required for discharging wastewater to rivers or onto the ground. These abstractions and discharges can have a significant impact on UK Rivers, but measurements are not readily available, which discourages their use in hydrological models of river flows. However, these very unique data sets provide a means to improve the performance of spatially distributed hydrological models, particularly during periods when abstraction regulations change and at ungauged river locations. To demonstrate this, point source abstraction and discharge measurements across England have been transformed into 1 {\texttimes} 1 km resolution gridded data and used with an enhanced formulation of the Grid-to-Grid (G2G) hydrological model where these processes are mathematically represented. A comparison of G2G-simulated and gauged river flows for 605 catchments across England between 1999 and 2014 indicates that model simulation of river flows is generally improved at gauged locations downstream of abstraction/discharge sites. The main improvement is in the simulation of low flows, for which the median performance is improved by 10.7\%, however, the impact on simulation of high river flows is more modest (1.5\% improvement). These results demonstrate the potential gains available to the international hydrological and land-surface modeling community from using records of actual water use (where available) in models, in place of more widely used national statistics.},

  abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) evasion from inland waters is an important component of the global carbon cycle. However, it remains unknown how global change affects CO2 emissions over longer time scales. Here, we present seasonal and annual fluxes of CO2 emissions from streams, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs throughout China and quantify their changes over the past three decades. We found that the CO2 emissions declined from 138\,{\textpm}\,31 Tg C yr-1 in the 1980s to 98\,{\textpm}\,19 Tg C yr-1 in the 2010s. Our results suggest that this unexpected decrease was driven by a combination of environmental alterations, including massive conversion of free-flowing rivers to reservoirs and widespread implementation of reforestation programs. Meanwhile, we found increasing CO2 emissions from the Tibetan Plateau inland waters, likely attributable to increased terrestrial deliveries of organic carbon and expanded surface area due to climate change. We suggest that the CO2 emissions from Chinese inland waters have greatly offset the terrestrial carbon sink and are therefore a key component of China's carbon budget.},

In recent decades, the warming in the Arctic has been much faster than in the rest of the world, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification. Numerous studies report that the Arctic is warming either twice, more than twice, or even three times as fast as the globe on average. Here we show, by using several observational datasets which cover the Arctic region, that during the last 43 years the Arctic has been warming nearly four times faster than the globe, which is a higher ratio than generally reported in literature. We compared the observed Arctic amplification ratio with the ratio simulated by state-of-the-art climate models, and found that the observed four-fold warming ratio over 1979-2021 is an extremely rare occasion in the climate model simulations. The observed and simulated amplification ratios are more consistent with each other if calculated over a longer period; however the comparison is obscured by observational uncertainties before 1979. Our results indicate that the recent four-fold Arctic warming ratio is either an extremely unlikely event, or the climate models systematically tend to underestimate the amplification.},

To address this topic, a water balance model SoilClim forced by climate reanalysis ERA5-Land was applied on a global scale to analyze the spatiotemporal variability of changes in soil moisture anomalies. The results revealed that the soil relative available water (AWR) significantly decreased on 31.1\% of global non-glaciated land and significantly increased on 5.3\% of such global non-glaciated land in 1981--2021. Decreasing AWR trends were detected over all continents and were particularly pronounced in South America, which experienced significant drying on more than half of the continent. The main drought `hotspots' were identified in equatorial Africa, a large part of South America, the Midwest United States, and in a belt extending from eastern Europe to eastern Asia. A seasonal analysis of region-specific patterns further suggested drying in Europe in summer but an absence of a drying trend in winter. These results were supported by an analysis of the area affected by percentile-based drought on individual continents, revealing statistically significant increasing trends of 5th- and 10th-percentile droughts on all continents except Australia at an annual scale. Nevertheless, summer and autumn drought frequency increases were also detected in Australia. The seasonal trends were the most rapid in South America and Europe (except in winter). The distributions of AWR values, evaluated by Z scores, shifted remarkably toward drier conditions during the 2001--2021 period, particularly in South America and Asia. These results underscore the alarming increase in soil drought on a global scale, highlighting the need for effective drought management strategies.},

  abstract = {Long term average change in streamflow is a major concern in hydrology and water resources management. Some simple analytical methods exist for the assessment of the sensitivity of streamflow to climatic variations. These are based on the Budyko hypothesis, which assumes that long term average streamflow can be predicted by climate conditions, namely by annual average precipitation and evaporative demand. Recently, Tomer and Schilling (2009) presented an ecohydrological concept to distinguish between effects of climate change and basin characteristics change on streamflow. We relate the concept to a coupled consideration of the water and energy balance. We show that the concept is equivalent to the assumption that the sum of the ratio of annual actual evapotranspiration to precipitation and the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration is constant, even when climate conditions are changing.   Here, we use this assumption to derive analytical solutions to the problem of streamflow sensitivity to climate. We show how, according to this assumption, climate sensitivity would be influenced by different climatic conditions and the actual hydrological response of a basin. Finally, the properties and implications of the method are compared with established Budyko sensitivity methods and illustrated by three case studies. It appears that the largest differences between both approaches occur under limiting conditions. Specifically, the sensitivity framework based on the ecohydrological concept does not adhere to the water and energy limits, while the Budyko approach accounts for limiting conditions by increasing the sensitivity of streamflow to a catchment parameter encoding basin characteristics. Our findings do not support any application of the ecohydrological concept under conditions close to the water or energy limits, instead we suggest a correction based on the Budyko framework.},

This simple theory accurately predicted the long-term evapotranspiration (E) and runoff (Q) for the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) in southeast Australia. We extend the theory by developing a simple and novel analytical expression for the effects on E and Q of small perturbations in P, Eo, and n. The theory predicts that a 10\% change in P, with all else constant, would result in a 26\% change in Q in the MDB. Future climate scenarios (2070?2099) derived using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR4 climate model output highlight the diversity of projections for P ({\textpm}30\%) with a correspondingly large range in projections for Q ({\textpm}80\%) in the MDB. We conclude with a qualitative description about the impact of changes in catchment properties on water availability and focus on the interaction between vegetation change, increasing atmospheric [CO2], and fire frequency. We conclude that the modern version of the Budyko framework is a useful tool for making simple and transparent estimates of changes in water availability.},

  abstract = {This study approaches the problem of downscaling global climate model simulations with an emphasis on validating and selecting global models. The downscaling method makes minimal, physically based corrections to the global simulation while preserving much of the statistics of interannual variability in the climate model. Differences among the downscaled results for simulations of present-day climate form a basis for model evaluation. The downscaled results are used to simulate streamflow in the Yakima River, a mountainous basin in Washington, USA, to illustrate how model differences affect streamflow simulations. The downscaling is applied to the output of three models (ECHAM4, HADCM3, and NCAR-PCM) for simulations of historic conditions (1900-2000) and two future emissions scenarios (A2 and B2 for 2000-2100) from the IPCC assessment. The ECHAM4 simulation closely reproduces the observed statistics of temperature and precipitation for the 42 year period 1949-90. Streamflow computed from this climate simulation likewise produces similar statistics to streamflow computed from the observed data. Downscaled climate-change scenarios from these models are examined in light of the differences in the present-day simulations. Streamflows simulated from the ECHAM4 results show the greatest sensitivity to climate change, with the peak in summertime flow occurring 2 months earlier by the end of the 21st century.

Existing models exhibit deficiencies such as overparameterization, the lack of an effective technique to integrate the spatial heterogeneity of physiographic characteristics, and the nontransferability of parameters across scales and locations. A multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR) technique is proposed as a way to address these issues simultaneously. Using this technique, parameters at a coarser scale, in which the dominant hydrological processes are represented, are linked with their corresponding ones at a finer resolution in which input data sets are available. The linkage is done with upscaling operators such as the harmonic mean, among others. Parameters at the finer scale are regionalized through nonlinear transfer functions which link basin predictors with global parameters to be determined through calibration. MPR was compared with a standard regionalization (SR) method in which basin predictors instead of model parameters are first aggregated. Both methods were tested in a basin located in Germany using a distributed hydrologic model. Results indicate that MPR is superior to SR in many respects, especially if global parameters are transferred from coarser to finer scales. Furthermore, MPR, as opposed to SR, preserves the spatial variability of state variables and conserves the mass balance with respect to a control scale. Cross-validation tests indicate that the transferability of the global parameters to ungauged locations is possible.},

  abstract = {Assessing reliability of global models is critical because of increasing reliance on these models to address past and projected future climate and human stresses on global water resources. Here, we evaluate model reliability based on a comprehensive comparison of decadal trends (2002-2014) in land water storage from seven global models (WGHM, PCR-GLOBWB, GLDAS NOAH, MOSAIC, VIC, CLM, and CLSM) to trends from three Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite solutions in 186 river basins (similar to 60\% of global land area). Medians of modeled basin water storage trends greatly underestimate GRACE-derived large decreasing ({$<$}=-0.5 km(3)/y) and increasing ({$>$}= 0.5 km(3)/y) trends. Decreasing trends from GRACE are mostly related to human use (irrigation) and climate variations, whereas increasing trends reflect climate variations. For example, in the Amazon, GRACE estimates a large increasing trend of similar to 43 km(3)/y, whereas most models estimate decreasing trends (-71 to 11 km(3)/y). Land water storage trends, summed over all basins, are positive for GRACE (similar to 71-82 km(3)/y) but negative for models (-450 to -12 km(3)/y), contributing opposing trends to global mean sea level change. Impacts of climate forcing on decadal land water storage trends exceed those of modeled human intervention by about a factor of 2. The model-GRACE comparison highlights potential areas of future model development, particularly simulated water storage. The inability of models to capture large decadal water storage trends based on GRACE indicates that model projections of climate and human-induced water storage changes may be underestimated.},

  abstract = {A parametric water balance model was developed based on statistical averaging of the main hydrological processes. The model has a two-layer structure with both a physical and statistical basis for the model parameters. It was developed to fill a need for models with a small number of parameters and of intermediate complexity between a one-parameter simple bucket and more complex hydrologically oriented models with many parameters such as the Sacramento model. The focus was to improve the representation of runoff relative to the simple bucket without introducing the full complexity of the Sacramento model. The model was designed to operate over a range of time steps to facilitate coupling to an atmospheric model. The model can be used for catchment scale simulations in hydrological applications and for simple representation of runoff in coupled atmospheric/hydrological models. An important role for the simple water balance (SWB) model is to assist in understanding how much complexity in representing land surface processes is needed and can be supported with available data to estimate model parameters. The model is tested using rainfall, runoff, and surface meteorological data for three catchments from different climate regimes. Model performance is compared to performance of a simple bucket model, the Sacramento model, and the Oregon State University land surface model. Finally, a series of tests were conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of SWB performance when it is operated at time steps different from the time step for which it was calibrated.},

Currently, parameter availability limits global-scale hydrologic modelling to very coarse resolution, hindering researchers from resolving fine-scale variability. With the aim of addressing this problem, we present a set of globally consistent soil and vegetation parameters for the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model at 1/16{$^\circ$} resolution (approximately 6\,km at the equator), with spatial coverage from 60{$^\circ$}S to 85{$^\circ$}N. Soil parameters derived from interpolated soil profiles and vegetation parameters estimated from space-based MODIS measurements have been compiled into input files for both the Classic and Image drivers of the VIC model, version 5. Geographical subsetting codes are provided, as well. Our dataset provides all necessary land surface parameters to run the VIC model at regional to global scale. We evaluate VICGlobal's ability to simulate the water balance in the Upper Colorado River basin and 12 smaller basins in the CONUS, and their ability to simulate the radiation budget at six SURFRAD stations in the CONUS.},

However, it is not well understood how the compound heatwave, extreme precipitation, and flash drought events will likely change, and how global population, agriculture, and forest will likely be exposed to these compound events under future climate change scenarios. This research uses eight CMIP6 climate models to assess the current and future global compound climate extreme events, as well as population, agriculture, and forestry exposures to these events, under two climate scenarios, Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP), SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 for three time periods: early-, mid-, and late- 21st century. Climate extremes are derived for heatwaves, extreme precipitation, and flash droughts using locational-dependent thresholds. We find that compound heatwaves and flash drought events result in the largest increases in exposure of populations, agriculture, and forest lands, under SSP5-8.5 late-century projections of sequential heatwaves and flash droughts. Late-century projections of sequential heatwaves and flash droughts show hot spots of exposure increases in population exposure greater than 50 million person-events in China, India, and Europe; increases in agriculture land exposures greater than 90 thousand km2-events in China, South America, and Oceania; and increase in forest land exposure greater than 120 thousand km2-events in Oceania and South America regions when compared to the historical period. The findings from this study can be potentially useful for informing global climate adaptations.},

  abstract = {Climate impact studies crucially rely on climate change information at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Since the most developed tools for estimating future climate change-the general circulation models (GCMs)-still operate on rather coarse spatial scales, their output has to be downscaled in order to provide the needed high resolution input for climate impact models. In this study, a perfect prognosis approach is employed to downscale daily local temperature extremes at several stations in south-eastern Australia from synoptic scale atmospheric circulation fields. The statistical model combines principal component analysis and linear multiple regression and is suitable to explain a considerable part of both short and long frequency variations of local temperature extremes. Using simulated and observed daily data the regional to local performance of the Mark2 GCM, developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), was validated over the Australian region. While the regional temperature extremes simulated under present-day climate conditions are in general agreement with the observed climate, there are highly significant differences on the local scale. The observed daily synoptic scale atmospheric circulation, however, is well reproduced by the GCM. This supports the idea of using these reliably simulated climatic parameters to estimate the changes in local temperature extremes under altered global climate conditions. The downscaling model was applied to synoptic scale atmospheric circulation fields generated by the CSIRO Mark2 GCM under 1 x CO2 and 2 x CO2 conditions. Compared to the extreme temperature changes simulated by the GCM directly, the downscaled variations are much weaker. Several sources of uncertainty might be causing these differences. Firstly, the statistical model is stationary. Therefore, it is not capable of including changes in the relationships between circulation and local temperature which are likely to occur under 2 x CO2 climate changes. It also only captures circulation-related temperature variations. An analysis of the circulation changes under 2 x CO2, however, reveals almost no significant differences to the present day conditions. That leads to the conclusion, that the quite dramatic changes of local temperature extremes under doubled CO2 are not driven by circulation changes and might be: almost solely caused by changed radiative properties of the atmosphere.

  abstract = {Hydrological processes in a watershed consist of multiple sub-processes (such as plant growth, evapotranspi\- ration, water yield, and soil--water balance) that have complex interactions. The common practice of calibrating hydrological models against only a single variable (e.g., streamflow) can lead to parameter uncertainty (also known as equifinality), resulting in significant uncertainties in the representation and simulation of subprocesses. As multi-variable calibration can be a potential solution to this issue, we tested the integration of spatially and temporally gridded remotely sensed evapotranspiration (RS-ET) data with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model. This approach was intended to reduce equifinality by enhancing related hydrological sub-processes in both space and time rather than improving the evaluation metrics at the streamflow outlet. We further introduced the principle of repeated measure design in the calibration process, where the SWAT was calibrated under two different schemes: Scheme1 (using only streamflow data) and Scheme2 (using both RS-ET and streamflow data). The model's performance was evaluated using the concept of stability at multiple spatial scales (basin outlet, sub-basins, and hydrological response units) and aspects (different model outputs and most sensitive calibrated parameters). The significance of the difference between the stabilities produced by the two schemes was estimated using the Mann--Whitney U test. Testing this approach in Meichuan Basin (China) showed that Scheme2 substantially reduced equifinality for calibrated parameters and model outputs compared to Scheme1. In addition, the model solutions and outputs for Scheme2 were significantly different from Scheme1. Our results demonstrate the added value of using increasingly available open-access RSET data for improving hydrological model calibration.},

  abstract = {Simulated data of atmospheric variables like precipitation is very important for climate science research, especially for understanding future scenarios. Such data is generated by global or regional climate models (GCM/ RCM), for both past and future periods under different initial conditions. Unfortunately, these models frequently display biases in simulated precipitation data compared to ground observations, due to their inability to incorporate the entire physics of the process accurately. It is imperative to mitigate such biases using contemporary techniques to make the simulated data a valuable end product. Our aim in this research is to correct seasonal (from June to September) Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) data as simulated by the Climate Forecast System (CFS) over the Indian subcontinent, with the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) data serving as the ground truth reference. This period is important as more than one-third of India's annual rainfall occurs during these months. This study presents a novel Deep Learning (DL) based architecture known as the Convolutional Neural Network for Bias Correction (CNNBC) that aims to calibrate the model-simulated data with past observations, to address these biases while preserving the statistical properties and spatial correlations relationships among grid points and enhancing the spatial mean of precipitation estimates. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we compare its performance to that of three other statistical and DL techniques: quantile mapping (QM), quantile delta mapping (QDM), and the SRDRN model. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the CNNBC model outperforms the other in terms of our task.},

  abstract = {High-mountain Asia (HMA) constitutes the largest glacierized region outside of the Earth's polar regions. Although available observations are limited, long-term records indicate sustained HMA glacier mass loss since similar to 1850, with accelerated loss in recent decades. Recent satellite data capture the spatial variability of this mass loss, but spatial resolution is coarse and some estimates for regional and HMA-wide mass loss disagree. To address these issues, we generated 5,797 high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) from available sub-meter commercial stereo imagery (DigitalGlobe WorldView-1/2/3 and GeoEye-1) acquired over HMA glaciers from 2007 to 2018 (primarily 2013-2017). We also reprocessed 28,278 ASTER DEMs over HMA from 2000 to 2018. We combined these observations to generate robust elevation change trend maps and geodetic mass balance estimates for 99\% of HMA glaciers between 2000 and 2018. We estimate total HMA glacier mass change of -19.0 +/- 2.5 Gt yr(-1) (-0.19 +/- 0.03 m w.e. yr(-1)). We document the spatial pattern of HMA glacier mass change with unprecedented detail, and present aggregated estimates for HMA glacierized sub-regions and hydrologic basins. Our results offer improved estimates for the HMA contribution to global sea level rise in recent decades with total cumulative sea-level rise contribution of similar to 0.7 mm from exorheic basins between 2000 and 2018. We estimate that the range of excess glacier meltwater runoff due to negative glacier mass balance in each basin constitutes similar to 12-53\% of the total basin-specific glacier meltwater runoff. These results can be used for calibration and validation of glacier mass balance models, satellite gravimetry observations, and hydrologic models needed for present and future water resource management.},

  abstract = {Climate change and underlying surface change are two main factors affecting the hydrological cycle. In respect of climate change, precipitation alters not only in magnitude, but also in intensity, which can be represented by precipitation depth. To further understand the spatial variation of the impact of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, precipitation depth and the water storage capacity during 1960-2010, 224 catchments located from arid areas to humid areas across China were analyzed in this paper based on the Choudhury-Porporato equation within the Budyko hypothesis. The results show that underlying surface change is the major driving force of runoff change in the Songhua Basin, the Liaohe Basin and the Haihe Basin, while climate change dominates runoff change in other basins. Climate change causes, runoff increase in most catchments, except for some catchments in the Yellow River Basin and the Yangtze River Basin. Specifically, changes in precipitation depth induce runoff increase in almost each catchment and show a considerable contribution rate (14.8\% on average, larger than 20\% in 32\% catchments). The contribution of precipitation depth change has little correlation with the aridity index, while positively correlates to the significance of trend in precipitation depth. This study suggests that precipitation depth is an important aspect that should be taken into consideration in attribution of runoff change. The findings in this study provide a sight for future researches in attribution analysis within the Budyko framework. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this study, the variation of urban construction land and landscape patterns were studied based on the remote sensing image classification data of 2005,2010, and 2015. The results show that: 1) In the region, the change rate of urban construction land in 2010-2015 is significantly higher than that of 2005-2010.; 2) The rapid expansion of urban landscape leads to the reduction of farmland, while the total area of ecological space such as that of forest and waters is almost unchanged.; 3) The farmland fragmentation is enhanced and the corresponding shape is more complicated, but the shape of urban landscape is more continuous and regular during the urban expansion process.; and 4) The interference of human activities to ecological space is increasing. Therefore, the conclusion of this study provides the basic data for the spatial planning and ecological environment protection of urban agglomeration in Yangtze River Delta. Not only that, but it also promotes the sustainable development of ecological resources in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, as well as makes social and economic contributions.

By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-the-art operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.},

Integrating gauge-based measurements with near-real-time SPPs is an effective approach for achieving precise spatial precipitation estimates at daily scale. This study proposed a newly developed error decomposition and fusion framework, named EDGWR, which integrates error decomposition and geographically weighted regression (GWR). The final merged product, denoted as IMERG-EDGWR, was obtained from the near-real-time Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement Early Run (IMERG-E) product. IMERG-EDGWR was compared with the raw IMERG-E, near-real-time IMERG-L, post-real-time IMERG-F, global multi-source merged precipitation data (MSWEP), interpolated results (IDW and OK), and direct application of GWR outcomes (IMERG-GWR), utilizing the daily ground measurements from 12 meteorological stations located in the Yellow River source region (YRSR). The evaluation results from 2014 to 2018 revealed that IMERG-EDGWR exhibited significant enhancements over the raw IMERG-E, surpassed the research-level IMERG-F, and generally outperformed IDW, OK, MSWEP, and IMERG-GWR. Notably, IMERG-EDGWR enhances the detection of heavy precipitation events, refining estimates of both magnitude and frequency for precipitation over 25~mm. During the winter season, IMERG-EDGWR produced the most accurate precipitation estimates with notable improvement of precipitation detection capabilities. An experiment reducing input data by excluding gauge observations from the GPCC dataset tested the robustness of the EDGWR algorithm, confirming its superiority even with diminished input data. The merging framework proposed in this study constitutes an efficacious and implementable solution to enhance the accuracy of near-real-time SPPs and is expected to be implemented in different regions in future research.},

Results show that the streamflow decline increased from the upstream to downstream regions. Combining hydrological simulation and statistical analysis, the contributions of climate change, human water consumption, reservoir impoundment and human-induced vegetation change on streamflow decline are estimated to be 62.5\%, 19.7\%, 18.4\% and 1.8\%, respectively. Specifically, human water consumption growth is consistent with the spatial pattern of population growth and industrial development, and the reservoir impoundments are mainly located in the middle and lower parts of the mainstream. In the Jialingjiang, the tributary with the largest drainage area in the UYR, human activities account for 63.6\% of the streamflow decline, with the largest decline induced by human water consumption growth. Under climate change and population growth, the population under water stress (water resources available less than 1000 m3/capita/yr) increases in the Mintuojiang and Jialingjiang, where the major cities are centralized and the population density is high. This study provides a new perspective for understanding the status of water resources in the UYR and offers insights into the sustainable utilization of water resources in the future.},

  abstract = {江河径流是陆地水循环的重要组成部分,而陆地水循环又是水循环的重要分量,与水沙、水化学和水生态过程存在多向互馈,它的变化也会对全球变化产生显著影响。在气候变化和人类活动的综合影响下,陆地水循环过程和通量发生改变,干旱和洪涝等极端水文事件频繁发生,同时对水资源产生了显著影响,诱发了一系列生态环境效应,对社会经济发展和生态环境健康造成危害。识别气候变化背景下典型江河径流的时空分布规律及演变趋势,能够为陆地水循环演变及其在全球变化中的作用研究奠定基础,更是应对全球气候变化、解决水危机的重要基础和关键支撑。本文选取了全球40条典型江河,对入海径流量和径流系数的时间变化趋势、空间分布规律进行了分析,并对基于Budyko假设的径流变化归因分析方法进行了改进,定量计算了降水、潜在蒸散发、下垫面、冰川融水及人类活动对径流量变化的弹性系数和贡献率。选取黄淮海流域和长江流域为典型区,运用聚类分析等方法分析了产水系数、产水模数的演变规律,降水量、暴雨日数、无雨日数、植被覆盖度和土地利用对产水系数的影响程度,及产水模数与降水特性的关系。基于径流系数与径流和降水的关系,利用40个典型流域径流系数进行空间插值,再根据降水数据得到全球陆地径流量分布,分别从大洲、纬度带及全球总体不同尺度对径流量的时间变化和空间分布进行了分析。本文主要结论如下:（1）典型江河中径流量呈下降趋势的河流较多,在北美洲和非洲,河流径流量主要呈下降趋势,在欧洲主要呈上升趋势。径流系数变化相对稳定,在少数人类活动影响较大的流域中呈下降趋势。气候因素是径流量变化的主要影响因素,仅有约1/4的河流径流量受人类活动影响较大。径流量在亚热带季风性湿润气候和热带草原气候带内多呈上升趋势;在热带雨林气候、热带季风气候带内多呈下降趋势;在温带季风气候、温带大陆性气候和温带海洋性气候带内变化不大,基本呈稳定状态。中高纬度带径流量多呈上升趋势,中低纬度带人类活动影响较大的地区径流量多呈下降趋势,同时径流系数也呈下降趋势。（2）黄淮海流域产水系数在时间上变化较小,总体趋势为西部下降、东部上升;在空间上,从黄河流域中北部向周围逐渐增大。从影响因素看,产水系数与降水量、暴雨日数呈正相关,与无雨日数呈负相关;NDVI与产水系数变化率虽为正相关,但两者上升率却为负相关;土地利用类型的影响相对较小。长江流域产水模数在时间变化上表现为东部上升、西部不显著下降。在空间上,除中部偏西地区有异常外,大致为从北到南逐渐增加。产水模数的时空变化均与降水有密切联系。（3）近50年全球陆地径流量呈不显著上升趋势,上世纪90年代以后其年际变化频率和幅度均增大。六大洲中,只有非洲呈显著下降趋势,其余各洲无显著变化趋势。高纬度地区呈显著上升趋势,中、低纬度地区变化趋势不显著。各大洲、各纬度带的分段趋势各不相同。中低纬度带位于亚洲中北和西南部、北美洲北部和西南部、非洲北部及大洋洲的地区,径流量、降水量和蒸散发量均较小。中高纬度带位于亚洲东部和欧洲的地区,径流量、降水量和蒸散发量均较大。南美洲北部和东南亚的赤道两侧低纬度地区,降水量、蒸散发量和径流量均很大。此外北美洲东部、南美洲东部和非洲中部部分地区,降水量、蒸散发量大但径流量小。},

  abstract = {Reference evapotranspiration (ET0), as one important variable in climatology, hydrology, and agricultural science, plays an important role in the terrestrial hydrological cycle and agricultural irrigation. However, the ET0 estimation process is inaccurate due to the lack of weather stations and historical data. In this study, a new method of ET0 estimation was proposed to improve the ET0 estimation performance in regions with limited data. Four empirical models with different data requirements, Albrecht, Hargreaves-Samani, Priestley-Taylor, and Penman, were applied and optimized the parameters by the Shuffled Complex Evolution-University of Arizona algorithm with the ET0 calculated by the Penman-Monteith model as the reference value at 600 meteorological stations in China. Two machine learning models, Random Forest (RF) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) were used to establish the regionalization of the parameter of the empirical model. The result showed that parameter optimization could significantly improve ET0 estimation in different climate regions of China. The Penman model has the strongest physical foundation and the highest estimation accuracy, followed by the Hargeaves-Samani and Priestley-Taylor model. The mass-transferbased model, Albrecht, could only estimate regional ET0 efficiently after parameter optimization. Based on the more advanced RF machine learning regionalization method that considers complex linear relationships of variables, ET0 estimation in regions lacking data could be improved efficiently. Machine learning could be used to describe the ET0 model parameters in different regions because of the similarity. The combination of machine learning and empirical model could provide a new method for ET0 estimation in data deficient regions.},

The daily energy fluxes were computed during melt seasons and correlated with each other and with air temperature on and outside the glacier. The relative contribution of each flux to the correlations between temperature and melt energy was assessed. At Zongo, net short-wave radiation controls the variability of the energy balance and is poorly correlated to temperature. On tropical glaciers, temperature remains low and varies little, melt energy is poorly correlated to temperature, and degree-day models are not appropriate to simulate daily melting. At the yearly scale, the temperature is better correlated to the mass balance because it integrates the ablation and the accumulation processes over a long time period. At Sorlin, the turbulent sensible heat flux is greater because of higher temperatures, but melt variability is still controlled by short-wave radiation. Temperature correlates well with melt energy mainly through short-wave radiation, probably because of diurnal advection of warm air from the valley. At Storglaciaren, high correlations between temperature and melt energy result from substantial variability of the sensible and latent heat fluxes ( which both supply energy to the glacier), and their good correlations with temperature. In the three climates, long-wave irradiance is the main source of energy, but its variability is small and poorly correlated to the temperature mainly because cloud emissions dominate its variability.},

Potential evapotranspiration (PET) represents atmospheric demand for water, which is required at high spatial and temporal resolutions to compute actual evapotranspiration and thus close the water balance near the land surface for many such applications, but there are currently no available high-resolution datasets of PET. Here we develop an hourly PET dataset (hPET) for the global land surface at 0.1{$^\circ$} spatial resolution, based on output from the recently developed ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset, over the period 1981 to present. We show how hPET compares to other available global PET datasets, over common spatiotemporal resolutions and time frames, with respect to spatial patterns of climatology and seasonal variations for selected humid and arid locations across the globe. We provide the data for users to employ for multiple applications to explore diurnal and seasonal variations in evaporative demand for water.},

  abstract = {The alteration in river flow patterns, particularly those that originate in the Himalaya, has been caused by the increased temperature and rainfall variability brought on by climate change. Due to the impending intensification of extreme climate events, as predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its Sixth Assessment Report, it is more essential than ever to predict changes in streamflow for future periods. Despite the fact that some research has utilised machine-learning- and deep-learning-based models to predict streamflow patterns in response to climate change, very few studies have been undertaken for a mountainous catchment, with the number of studies for the western Himalaya being minimal. This study investigates the capability of five different machine learning (ML) models and one deep learning (DL) model, namely the Gaussian linear regression model (GLM), Gaussian generalised additive model (GAM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARSs), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and 1D convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), in streamflow prediction over the Sutlej River basin in the western Himalaya during the periods 2041--2070 (2050s) and 2071--2100 (2080s). Bias-corrected data downscaled at a grid resolution of 0.25{$\circ$} {\texttimes} 0.25{$\circ$} from six general circulation models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 GCM framework under two greenhouse gas (GHG) trajectories (SSP245 and SSP585) were used for this purpose. Four different rainfall scenarios (R0, R1, R2, and R3) were applied to the models trained with daily data (1979--2009) at Kasol (the outlet of the basin) in order to better understand how catchment size and the geo-hydromorphological aspects of the basin affect runoff. The predictive power of each model was assessed using six statistical measures, i.e. the coefficient of determination (R2), the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of the measured data (RSR), the mean absolute error (MAE), the Kling--Gupta efficiency (KGE), the Nash--Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and the percent bias (PBIAS). The RF model with rainfall scenario R3, which outperformed other models during the training (R2 = 0.90; RSR = 0.32; KGE = 0.87; NSE = 0.87; PBIAS = 0.03) and testing (R2 = 0.78; RSR = 0.47; KGE = 0.82; NSE = 0.71; PBIAS = -0.31) period, therefore was chosen to simulate streamflow in the Sutlej River in the 2050s and 2080s under the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios. Bias correction was further applied to the projected daily streamflow in order to generate a reliable times series of the discharge. The mean ensemble of the model results shows that the mean annual streamflow of the Sutlej River is expected to rise between 2050s and 2080s by 0.79 \% to 1.43 \% for SSP585 and by 0.87 \% to 1.10 \% for SSP245. In addition, streamflow will increase during the monsoon (9.70 \% to 11.41 \% and 11.64 \% to 12.70 \%) in the 2050s and 2080s under both emission scenarios, but it will decrease during the pre-monsoon (-10.36 \% to -6.12 \% and -10.0 \% to -9.13 \%), post-monsoon (-1.23 \% to -0.22 \% and -5.59 \% to -2.83 \%), and during the winter (-21.87 \% to -21.52 \% and -21.87 \% to -21.11 \%). This variability in streamflow is highly correlated with the pattern of precipitation and temperature predicted by CMIP6 GCMs for future emission scenarios and with physical processes operating within the catchment. Predicted declines in the Sutlej River streamflow over the pre-monsoon (April to June) and winter (December to March) seasons might have a significant impact on agriculture downstream of the river, which is already having problems due to water restrictions at this time of year. The present study will therefore assist in strategy planning to ensure the sustainable use of water resources downstream by acquiring knowledge of the nature and causes of unpredictable streamflow patterns.},

It relates to the dissolved and solid loads of the two main rivers of French Guiana, the Maroni and Oyapock rivers, running on the Guiana Shield and draining respectively 64 230 and 24 630 km(2). The low coefficient of variation of the average annual flows of the two rivers indicates an inter-annual hydrological stability probably related to the immediate vicinity of the Atlantic Ocean. The sedimentary load is mainly composed of quartz and kaolinite. The total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations are among the world's lowest values; they range from 1 to 130 mg l(-1) during the hydrological cycle, with averages of 22 and 12 mg l(-1), for the Maroni and Oyapock rivers, respectively. The seasonal variability of these values is significantly higher than that of hydrologic flows, but without simple relationship with the discharge. Water chemical composition of the two rivers indicates a very weak mineralization, very similar to that found in the Amazonian rivers running on the Brazilian and Guianese shields, and in the Congo River and its tributaries in the Central African Shield. Seasonal variations are observed in both basins; they correspond to higher concentrations during low water stage (from October to February) and to more diluted water during the flood, from April to July. A signature enriched in Cl- is present at the Saut Maripa station on the Oyapock River indicating a more marked influence of the trade winds in this basin. The computation of atmospheric contributions to ions budget indicated a weak contribution for Ca2+ and Mg2+, which originates mainly from water-rock interactions in both stations, while more than half of Na+ is derived from atmospheric inputs.

  abstract = {Editor: Dr Ouyang Wei This study compared the performance of Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) and Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in simulating observed runoff and projecting future runoff using 11 CMIP6 GCMs. The projected runoff was estimated for two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), 2-4.5 and 5-8.5 for near (2021-2060) and far (2061-2100) futures, respectively. The biases in GCM simulated climate variables were corrected using quantile mapping considering observations at 6 weather stations as reference data over the historical period (1985-2014). Five evaluation metrics were used to quantify the GCM's and hydrological models' capability to reconstruct climate variables and runoff in the Yeongsan Basin of South Korea. Uncertainties in LSTM and SWAT simulated runoff for the historical and projected periods were quantified using Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and reliability ensemble averaging (REA), respectively. The results showed significant improvement in bias-corrected GCMs in replicating observations in terms of all evaluation metrics. The extreme runoff estimated using general extreme value (GEV) distribution revealed the better capability of LSTM than SWAT in reproducing observed runoff at all gauging locations. The SWAT projected an increase (17.7\%) while LSTM projected a decrease (-13.6\%) in the future runoff for both SSPs at most locations. The uncertainty in LSTM simulated runoff was lower than in SWAT runoff at all stations for the historical period. However, the uncertainty in SWAT projected runoff was lower than LSTM projected runoff for both SSPs. This study helps assessing the ability of deep-learning versus physically-based models in hydrological modeling and therefore opens new perspectives for hydrological modeling applications.},

The permafrost at the UYRB, with thickening active layer and lengthening thawing duration, has degraded by 10.8\%. The seasonally frozen ground has a more pronounced intra-annual regulation that replenishes surface runoff in the warm season, while the degradation of permafrost leads to a runoff increase. The occurrence of extreme events at the UYRB has gradually decreased with the degradation of frozen ground, but spring droughts and autumn floods become more serious.

However, the increasing complexity of hydrological models means that a large number of parameters need to be estimated. To better understand how these complex models work, efficient SA methods should be applied before the application of hydrological modeling. This study provides a comprehensive review of global SA methods in the field of hydrological modeling. The common definitions of SA and the typical categories of SA methods are described. A wide variety of global SA methods have been introduced to provide a more efficient evaluation framework for hydrological modeling. We review, analyze, and categorize research into global SA methods and their applications, with an emphasis on the research accomplished in the hydrological modeling field. The advantages and disadvantages are also discussed and summarized. An application framework and the typical practical steps involved in SA for hydrological modeling are outlined. Further discussions cover several important and often overlooked topics, including the relationship between parameter identification, uncertainty analysis, and optimization in hydrological modeling, how to deal with correlated parameters, and time-varying SA. Finally, some conclusions and guidance recommendations on SA in hydrological modeling are provided, as well as a list of important future research directions that may facilitate more robust analyses when assessing hydrological modeling performance.

  abstract = {Northern Shaanxi, a major coal base in China, is facing water scarcity, soil erosion, and ecological deterioration. We chose the Kuye and Tuwei Rivers as the study area, in which many underground mining bases have operated in these catchments since the late 1980s. The objective of this study was to quantify the anthropogenic impacts of runoff on the main rivers in the mining region. First, trend analysis and change-point detection were used to examine changes in the magnitude of annual runoff. Then, the contributions of precipitation changes and human activities to runoff changes were distinguished. Linear regression and comparative analysis were used to quantify the extents of human impacts on the runoff in two representative catchments. The results showed that the annual runoff in both catchments decreased significantly at the 99\% confidence level during 1960-2016. The significant change in the runoff occurred in 1997 in the Kuye River (KYH) catchment because of coal mining, while it occurred in 1980 in the Tuwei River (TWH) catchment due to soil and water conservation measures. The contribution of human activities to the runoff change was estimated to account for 91\% and 42\% in the KYH catchment and TWH catchment, respectively, whereas climate change accounted for 9\% and 58\%, respectively. Moreover, by reconstructing the time series of runoff, we surmise that anthropogenic interventions lead to a decrease in the average annual runoff by 168-344 million m(3) (in the KYH catchment) and 152 million m(3) (in the TWH catchment), respectively, during the descending period (1997-2016).},

  abstract = {Frozen soil undergoing freeze-thaw cycles has effects on local hydrology, ecosystems, and engineering infrastructure by global warming. It is important to clarify the hydrological processes of frozen soil, especially permafrost. In this study, the performance of a distributed cryosphere-hydrology model (WEB-DHM, Water and Energy Budget-based Distributed Hydrological Model) was significantly improved by the addition of enthalpy-based permafrost physics. First, we formulated the water phase change in the unconfined aquifer and its exchanges of water and heat with the upper soil layers, with enthalpy adopted as a prognostic variable instead of soil temperature in the energy balance equation to avoid instability when calculating water phase changes. Second, more reasonable initial conditions for the bottom soil layer (overlying the unconfined aquifer) were considered. The improved model (hereinafter WEB-DHM-pf) was carefully evaluated at three sites with seasonally frozen ground and one permafrost site over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau ("the Third Pole"), to demonstrate the capability of predicting the internal processes of frozen soil at the point scale, particularly the "zero-curtain" phenomenon in permafrost. Four different experiments were conducted to assess the impacts of augmentation of single model improvement on simulating soil water/ice and temperature dynamics in frozen soil. Finally, the WEB-DHM-pf was demonstrated to be capable of accurately reproducing the zero curtain, detecting long-term changes in frozen soil at the point scale, and discriminating basin-wide permafrost from seasonally frozen ground in a basin at the headwaters of the Yellow River.},

  abstract = {River runoff in the Arctic and the Tibetan Plateau (TP) change significantly in recent decades. However, the mechanisms of the physical processes of permafrost river runoff change remain uncertain across large scale. This study investigated the mainstreams and tributaries of main Arctic and TP rivers dominated by permafrost and assessed the linkage between hydrological regime change and permafrost. The results show that the effects of permafrost on river runoff are highly dependent on the permafrost coverage of a watershed. For the past decades, the majority of the Arctic and TP basins showed increased discharge, while all of the studied basins showed increased baseflow, with faster increasing speed than total discharge. Both total discharge and baseflow annual change rate (Delta Q and Delta BF) increased with permafrost coverage, indicating the increments of streamflow are enhanced with high permafrost coverage. Meanwhile, the annual change of precipitation showed weak connection with total discharge and baseflow change. The high permafrost coverage basins showed high annual maximum/minimum discharge ratio (Q(max)/Q(min)), while the Q(max)/Q(min) changed slightly in low permafrost cover basins. Our results highlight the importance of permafrost coverage on streamflow regime change for permafrost basins across the northern hemisphere. Due to these linkage between permafrost extent and runoff regime change and the increasing changes of permafrost, more attention should be paid to the change of hydrological processes in permafrost-underlain basins.},

The commonly used multiple linear regression (MLR) method may not be applicable in complex and nonlinear relationships between model parameters and watershed properties. Moreover, most regionalization methods assume lumped parameters for each catchment without considering within-catchment heterogeneity. Here we incorporated the Penman- Monteith-Leuning (PML) equation into the Distributed Time Variant Gain Model (DTVGM) to improve the mechanistic representation of the evapotranspiration (ET) process. We calibrated six key model parameters, grid by grid across China, using a multivariable calibration strategy which incorporates spatiotemporal runoff and ET datasets (0.25 degrees; monthly) as reference. In addition, we used the gradient boosting machine (GBM), a machine learning technique, to portray the dependence of model parameters on soil and terrain attributes in four distinct climatic zones across China. We show that the modified DTVGM could reasonably estimate the runoff and ET over China using the calibrated parameters but performed better in humid rather than arid regions for the validation period. The regionalized parameters by the GBM method exhibited better spatial coherence relative to the calibrated grid-by-grid parameters. In addition, GBM outperformed the stepwise MLR method in both parameter regionalization and gridded runoff simulations at a national scale, though the improvement pertaining to watershed streamflow validation is not significant due to most of the watersheds being located in humid regions. We also revealed that the slope, saturated soil moisture content, and elevation are the most important explanatory variables to inform model parameters based on the GBM approach. The machine-learning-based regionalization approach provides an effective alternative to deriving hydrological model parameters from watershed properties, particularly in ungauged regions.},

  abstract = {[1] The use of uncertainty analysis is gaining considerable attention in catchment hydrological modeling. In particular, the choice of appropriate model structure, identifiability of parameter values, and the reduction of model predictive uncertainty are deemed as essential elements of hydrological modeling. The chosen model structure must be parsimonious, and the parameters used must either be derivable from field-measured data or inferred unambiguously from analysis of catchment response data. In this paper, a long-term water balance model for the Susannah Brook catchment in Western Australia has been pursued using the "downward approach,'' which is a systematic approach to determine the model with the minimum level of complexity, with parameter values that, in theory, are derivable from existing physiographic data relating to the catchment. Through analysis of rainfall-runoff response at three different timescales and exploring the climate, soil, and vegetation controls on the water balance response at these timescales, an initial model structure was formulated, and a priori model parameter values were estimated. Further investigation with the use of auxiliary data such as deuterium concentration in the streamflow exposed inadequacies in the chosen model structure. Two more model structures were then proposed and investigated through formulating alternative hypotheses regarding the underlying causes of observed variability, including those suggested by observed deuterium composition in the streamflows and observed groundwater level dynamics. Along the way, the resulting models were systematically evaluated in three dimensions: ability to reproduce observations, predictive uncertainty, and physical realism. The final model, which included an efficient but detailed representation of unsaturated zone time delay, was found to be superior on all three counts, i.e., improved performance, reduced predictive uncertainty, and improved physical realism. These improvements can be directly attributed to the use of the auxiliary data ( deuterium composition and groundwater level dynamics), which identified weaknesses in previous model structures, and the multiple wetting front model of water movement in the unsaturated zone, which captured more effectively the time delay in the unsaturated zone.},

This paper investigates the consistency with which two global optimization methods, the shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA) method (developed by the authors) and the multistart simplex (MSX) method, are able to find the optimal parameter set during calibration of the Sacramento soil moisture accounting model (SAC-SMA) of the National Weather Service River Forecast System (NWSRFS). In the first phase of this study, error-free synthetic data are used to conduct a comparative evaluation of the algorithms under ''ideal'' conditions. In 10 independent trials of each algorithm in which 13 parameters of the SAC-SMA model were optimized simultaneously, the SCE-UA method achieved a 100\% success rate in locating the precise global optimum (i.e., the ''true'' parameter values) while the MSX method failed in all trials even with more than twice the number of function evaluations. In the second phase, historical data from the Leaf River watershed are used to conduct a comparative evaluation of the algorithms under ''real'' conditions, using two different estimation criteria, DRMS and HMLE; the SCE-UA algorithm obtained consistently lower function values and more closely grouped parameter estimates, while using one-third fewer function evaluations than the MSX algorithm.},

  abstract = {An overall appraisal of runoff changes at the European scale has been hindered by 'white space' on maps of observed trends due to a paucity of readily-available streamflow data. This study tested whether this white space can be filled using estimates of trends derived from model simulations of European runoff. The simulations stem from an ensemble of eight global hydrological models that were forced with the same climate input for the period 1963-2000. The derived trends were validated for 293 grid cells across the European domain with observation-based trend estimates. The ensemble mean overall provided the best representation of trends in the observations. Maps of trends in annual runoff based on the ensemble mean demonstrated a pronounced continental dipole pattern of positive trends in western and northern Europe and negative trends in southern and parts of eastern Europe, which has not previously been demonstrated and discussed in comparable detail. Overall, positive trends in annual streamflow appear to reflect the marked wetting trends of the winter months, whereas negative annual trends result primarily from a widespread decrease in streamflow in spring and summer months, consistent with a decrease in summer low flow in large parts of Europe. High flow appears to have increased in rain-dominated hydrological regimes, whereas an inconsistent or decreasing signal was found in snow-dominated regimes. The different models agreed on the predominant continental-scale pattern of trends, but in some areas disagreed on the magnitude and even the direction of trends, particularly in transition zones between regions with increasing and decreasing runoff trends, in complex terrain with a high spatial variability, and in snow-dominated regimes. Model estimates appeared most reliable in reproducing observed trends in annual runoff, winter runoff, and 7-day high flow. Modelled trends in runoff during the summer months, spring (for snow influenced regions) and autumn, and trends in summer low flow were more variable - both among models and in the spatial patterns of agreement between models and the observations. The use of models to display changes in these hydrological characteristics should therefore be viewed with caution due to higher uncertainty.},

This study investigates streamflow trends in a newly-assembled, consolidated dataset of near-natural streamflow records from 441 small catchments in 15 countries across Europe. The period 1962-2004 provided the best spatial coverage, but analyses were also carried out for longer time periods (with fewer stations), starting in 1932, 1942 and 1952. Trends were calculated by the slopes of the Kendall-Theil robust line for standardized annual and monthly streamflow, as well as for summer low flow magnitude and timing. A regionally coherent picture of annual streamflow trends emerged, with negative trends in southern and eastern regions, and generally positive trends elsewhere. Trends in monthly streamflow for 1962-2004 elucidated potential causes for these changes, as well as for changes in hydrological regimes across Europe. Positive trends were found in the winter months in most catchments. A marked shift towards negative trends was observed in April, gradually spreading across Europe to reach a maximum extent in August. Low flows have decreased in most regions where the lowest mean monthly flow occurs in summer, but vary for catchments which have flow minima in winter and secondary low flows in summer. The study largely confirms findings from national and regional scale trend analyses, but clearly adds to these by confirming that these tendencies are part of coherent patterns of change, which cover a much larger region. The broad, continental-scale patterns of change are mostly congruent with the hydrological responses expected from future climatic changes, as projected by climate models. The patterns observed could hence provide a valuable benchmark for a number of different studies and model simulations.},

At the plateau scale, the annual precipitation is projected to increase by 5.0-10.0\% in the near term (2011-2040) and 10.0-20.0\% in the long term (2041-2070) relative to the reference period 1971-2000. The annual temperature is projected to increase for all the scenarios with the greatest warming in the northwest (2.0-4.0 degrees C) and least in the southeast (1.2-2.8 degrees C). The total runoff of the study basins would either remain stable or moderately increase in the near term, and increase by 2.7-22.4\% in the long term relative to the reference period, as a result of increased rainfall-induced runoff for the upstream of the Yellow, Yangtze, Salween, and Mekong and increased glacier melt for the upper Indus. In the upper Brahmaputra, more than 50.0\% of the total runoff increase is attributed to the increased glacier melt in the long run. The annual hydrograph remains practically unchanged for all the monsoon-dominated basins. However, for the westerly-controlled basin (upper Indus), an apparent earlier melt and a relatively large increase in spring runoff are observed for all the scenarios, which would increase water availability in the Indus Basin irrigation scheme during the spring growing season.

  abstract = {In this paper, future drought characteristics (frequency, duration and intensity) over China are analysed by using four climate models from CMIP6 under the seven SSP-RCP (shared socioeconomic pathway-representative concentration pathway) scenarios (SSP119, SSP126, SSP434, SSP245, SSP460, SSP370, and SSP585) for three defined periods of 2021-2040 (near-term), 2041-2060 (mid-term) and 2081-2100 (long-term). The corresponding four climate models output from CMIP5 are also used to conduct a comparison analysis between CMIP5 and CMIP6 to address the improvements added to CMIP6 in terms of drought identification. The drought characteristics are identified by applying the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI) at a 12-month timescale and run theory. The results show that CMIP6 has a robust capability to capture historical (1986-2005) drought characteristics. For the future period of 2021-2040, the decrease in precipitation and increase in potential evapotranspiration will lead to continuous dry conditions in the upper and middle Yangtze River basin and eastern Pearl River basin. Relative to the reference period, drought events will be more frequent and severe with longer durations in the Northwest River basins and middle Yangtze River basin. Furthermore, higher emissions signify a greater increase in drought frequency and intensity in the long-term period. Except for the SSP585 scenario, the lower emission scenario corresponds to the higher drought duration soon and in the mid-21st century (2021-2060). This finding is regarded as a "strange phenomenon", which cannot be detected by the previous CMIP5-based emission scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and the unlikely pathway RCP8.5). Therefore, additional "possible future"-based scenarios (SSP119, SSP126, SSP434, SSP245, SSP460, and SSP370) should be included in extreme climate studies, especially for the near future and mid-21st century. Notably, compared with CMIP5, the reduced biases in drought characteristics are more likely associated with improvements in the representation of physical processes in climate models from CMIP6. The results of this study could provide a basis for the development of drought adaptation measures over China.},

  abstract = {Long-term streamflow trends are closely related to meteorological factors; understanding the relationships between them helps to improve water resources management in advance. In this study, we examined long-term annual and seasonal streamflow trends over 1961-2010 in 28 stations in the Songhua River Basin (SRB), China, using four kinds of trend detection methods and then determined the optimal meteorological predictors for SRB streamflow based on the multiple wavelet coherence. We found significant downward trends in annual streamflow in a large part of the study stations (varies from 10 to 18 for different methods), and fewer decreasing stations were detected when we consider the full autocorrelation and the long-term persistence in streamflow. In contrast to annual streamflow, fewer stations showed significant downward trends in summer and winter streamflow. Streamflow generally followed the pattern of precipitation (PRE); the largest streamflow changes occurred in summer and August monthly streamflow variation contributed the most to the annual streamflow variation. We found PRE and potential evapotranspiration (PET) combined was the optimal predictor for streamflow above Jiangqiao and on the Jiangqiao-Dalai section of the Songhua River; as for the Dalai-Harbin section and the Harbin-Jiamusi section, the optimal predictor combinations are PRE and number of rainy days (WET), and PRE and average monthly temperature (TMP) respectively.},

Our results found widespread and spatially consistent exacerbation of drought and pluvial extremes, especially summer drought and winter pluvials, with drying in the west and south, wetting trends in the northeast, and intensification of both extremes across the east and north.

Trends and abrupt change points of the hydro-climatic variables in the Tao River Basin were investigated during 1956e2015. It also quantitatively separates the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff change in the Tao River by using RCC-WBM model. Results indicate that temperature presented a significant rising trend (0.2  C per decade) while precipitation exhibited an insignificant decreasing trend (3.8 mm per decade) during 1956e2015. Recorded runoff in the Tao River decreased significantly with a magnitude of {\`A}13.7 mm per decade and abrupt changes in 1968 and 1986 were identified. Relative to the baseline period (1956e1968), runoff in the two anthropogenic disturbed periods of 1969e1986 and 1987e2015 decreased by 27.8 mm and 76.5 mm, respectively, which can be attributed to human activities (accounting for 69\%) and climate change (accounting for 31\%). Human activities are the principal drivers of runoff reduction in the Tao River Basin. However, the absolute influences on runoff reductions by the both drivers tend to increase, from 7.7 mm in 1969e1986 to 24.4 mm in 1987e2015 by climate change and from 20.2 mm to 52.2 mm by human activities.},

  abstract = {Physically based distributed hydrological models are widely used for hydrological simulations in various environments. As with conceptual models, they are limited in data-sparse basins by the lack of streamflow data for calibration. Short periods of observational data (less than 1 year) may be obtained from fragmentary historical records of previously existing gauging stations or from temporary gauging during field surveys, which might be of value for model calibration. However, unlike lumped conceptual models, such an approach has not been explored sufficiently for physically based distributed models. This study explored how the use of limited continuous daily streamflow data might support the application of a physically based distributed model in data-sparse basins. The influence of the length of the observation period on the calibration of the widely applied soil and water assessment tool model was evaluated in four Chinese basins with differing climatic and geophysical characteristics. The evaluations were conducted by comparing calibrations based on short periods of data with calibrations based on data from a 3-year period, which were treated as benchmark calibrations of the four basins, respectively. To ensure the differences in the model simulations solely come from differences in the calibration data, the generalized likelihood uncertainty analysis scheme was employed for the automatic calibration and uncertainty analysis. In the four basins, contrary to the common understanding of the need for observations over a period of several years, data records with lengths of less than 1 year were shown to calibrate the model effectively, i.e., performances similar to the benchmark calibrations were achieved. The models of the wet Jinjiang and Donghe basins could be effectively calibrated using a shorter data record (1 month), compared with the dry Heihe and upstream Yalongjiang basins (6 months). Even though the four basins are very different, when using 1-year or 6-month (covering a whole dry season or rainy season) data, the results show that data from wet seasons and wet years are generally more reliable than data from dry seasons and dry years, especially for the two dry basins. The results demonstrated that this idea could be a promising approach to the problem of calibration of physically based distributed hydrological models in data-sparse basins, and findings from the discussion in this study are valuable for assessing the effectiveness of short-period data for model calibration in real-world applications.},

  abstract = {Stream temperatures in urban watersheds are influenced to a high degree by changes in landscape and climate, which can occur at small temporal and spatial scales. Here, we describe a modelling system that integrates the distributed hydrologic soil vegetation model with the semi-Lagrangian stream temperature model RBM. It has the capability to simulate spatially distributed hydrology and water temperature over the entire network at high time and space resolutions, as well as to represent riparian shading effects on stream temperatures. We demonstrate the modelling system through application to the Mercer Creek watershed, a small urban catchment near Bellevue, Washington. The results suggest that the model was able to produce realistic streamflow and water temperature predictions that are consistent with observations. We use the modelling construct to characterize impacts of land use change and near-stream vegetation change on stream temperatures and explore the sensitivity of stream temperature to changes in land use and riparian vegetation. The results suggest that, notwithstanding general warming as a result of climate change over the last century, there have been concurrent increases in low flows as a result of urbanization and deforestation, which more or less offset the effects of a warmer climate on stream temperatures. On the other hand, loss of riparian vegetation plays a more important role in modulating water temperatures, in particular, on annual maximum temperature (around 4 degrees C), which could be mostly reversed by restoring riparian vegetation in a fairly narrow corridor - a finding that has important implications for management of the riparian corridor.

  abstract = {Abstract             Climate change impact studies are subject to numerous uncertainties and assumptions. One of the main sources of uncertainty arises from the interpretation of climate model projections. Probabilistic procedures based on multimodel ensembles have been suggested in the literature to quantify this source of uncertainty. However, the interpretation of multimodel ensembles remains challenging. Several assumptions are often required in the uncertainty quantification of climate model projections. For example, most methods often assume that the climate models are independent and/or that changes in climate model biases are negligible. This study develops a Bayesian framework that accounts for model dependencies and changes in model biases and compares it to estimates calculated based on a frequentist approach. The Bayesian framework is used to investigate the effects of the two assumptions on the uncertainty quantification of extreme precipitation projections over Denmark. An ensemble of regional climate models from the Ensemble-Based Predictions of Climate Changes and their Impacts (ENSEMBLES) project is used for this purpose.             The results confirm that the climate models cannot be considered independent and show that the bias depends on the value of precipitation. This has an influence on the results of the uncertainty quantification. Both the mean and spread of the change in extreme precipitation depends on both assumptions. If the models are assumed independent and the bias constant, the results will be overconfident and may be treated as more precise than they really are. This study highlights the importance of investigating the underlying assumptions in climate change impact studies, as these may have serious consequences for the design of climate change adaptation strategies.},

  abstract = {Actual evapotranspiration (AE) is a key component of water cycle. The arid climate of northwest China makes water supply a major constraint on AE. Water source analysis is of great significance to study the causes of AE change. In this paper, we presented an assessment of AE trends in northwest China based on GLEAM (AE\_GLEAM), an ensemble of six reanalyses (AE\_reanalyses), and a complementary-relationship-based AE dataset (AE\_CR). Both AE\_GLEAM and AE\_reanalyses increased significantly (p~{$<~$}0.001) during 1981--2017. AE\_CR also increased to a certain extent, but the rate was slower. In general, the increasing trends of AE were mainly found in mountainous areas, such as the Altai, Tianshan, Karakoram, Kunlun, Altun, and Qilian Mountains. For these regions, AE was even higher than precipitation in terms of both the climatological mean and the linear trends. It demonstrated that terrestrial water storage (S) could give supplementary supply for AE. Therefore, we extended the Budyko framework to evaluate the effect of S on AE. Taking the landscape parameter n~=~1.8 as a reference, S contributed approximately 27\% of total water availability for AE. Overall, S seemed to be a major contributor to the increasing AE in the Altai, Tianshan, Qilian, and Altun Mountains. Precipitation was the main source of evaporated water in the western Tianshan to Karakoram Mountains, where potential evapotranspiration also contributed to the increase in AE. In the case of different n values, the contribution from S had a deviation range of -16.9\% to 8.5\%. This model provides an opportunity to assess the response of AE to S in the absence of observational data.},

Sector-specific water demand, groundwater and surface water withdrawal, water consumption, and return flows are dynamically calculated at every time step and interact directly with the simulated hydrology. PCR-GLOBWB 2 has been fully rewritten in Python and PCRaster Python and has a modular structure, allowing easier replacement, maintenance, and development of model components. PCR-GLOBWB 2 has been implemented at 5 arcmin resolution, but a version parameterized at 30 arcmin resolution is also available. Both versions are available as open-source codes on https://github. com/UU-Hydro/PCR-GLOBWB\_model (Sutanudjaja et al., 2017a). PCR-GLOBWB 2 has its own routines for groundwater dynamics and surface water routing. These relatively simple routines can alternatively be replaced by dynamically coupling PCR-GLOBWB 2 to a global two-layer groundwater model and 1-D-2-D hydrodynamic models. Here, we describe the main components of the model, compare results of the 30 and 5 arcmin versions, and evaluate their model performance using Global Runoff Data Centre discharge data. Results show that model performance of the 5 arcmin version is notably better than that of the 30 arcmin version. Furthermore, we compare simulated time series of total water storage (TWS) of the 5 arcmin model with those observed with GRACE, showing similar negative trends in areas of prevalent groundwater depletion. Also, we find that simulated total water withdrawal matches reasonably well with reported water withdrawal from AQUASTAT, while water withdrawal by source and sector provide mixed results.},

  abstract = {To develop effective adaptation strategies for climate change, particularly in regions where water is scarce, it is crucial to comprehend and quantify how hydrological responses are influenced by anthropogenic activities and climate change. The primary concern nowadays is to identify the hydrologic sensitive and resilient catchment under these diverse conditions. Thus, a framework is developed in this study to analyse the hydrologic sensitivity and resiliency of a catchment incorporating the elasticity-based Budyko approach. The developed framework is applied to three neighbouring catchments (Brahmani, Baitarani, and Subarnarekha) in eastern India that have received less attention in light of resiliency and sensitivity perspectives. The Budyko approach is first applied using hydro-climatic records of historical phase (1979-2018) and then extended for future phase (2025-2064) under four different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) (1-2.6, 2-4.5, 3-7.0 and 5-8.5) of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) projections which will provide new insights to the hydrological community. The results highlight that streamflow variations of the Subarnarekha is more sensitive to anthropogenic activities in all time phases. In contrast, the Brahmani and Baitarani are more sensitive to climate change in future phases. During historical phase, the Brahmani and Baitarani are identified to be resilient catchments with high water yield and dry climate, whereas the Subarnarekha is found to be sensitive catchment, exhibiting low water yield and dry climate. However, in future phase, all three catchments are predicted to be resilient, characterized by high water yield and wet climate. The major inference from this study is excess anthropogenic activities can disrupt the anticipated hydrological functioning of a catchment, particularly under critical climatic conditions, which can result in decreasing hydrological resiliency. The finding of this study mainly highlights the response of a hydrological system to climate change and anthropogenic activities to explore the approach of sensitivity and resiliency from a socio-hydrological perspective.},

  abstract = {Vegetation and climate play critical roles in the hydrological cycle as vital components of the earth system. Understanding the impacts of changes in vegetation composition and climate on hydrological processes is essential for water balance and sustainable water resource management. We analyzed the effects of changes in vegetation composition and climate variability on streamflow changes in 3434 global watersheds from 2003 to 2016 using the Budyko framework. We found that ignoring changes in terrestrial water storage would result in large errors in the influence of landscape changes on streamflow changes. The sensitivity of streamflow changes to climate seasonality index (CSI), precipitation seasonality index (PSI), total vegetation coverage (M), tree coverage (MT), and non-tree coverage (MNT) varied in different regions. Effective precipitation (Pe), potential evapotranspiration (PET), CSI, PSI, M, MT, and MNT changes were the dominant factor in streamflow changes for 64.8\%, 3.0\%, 5.1\%, 4.1\%, 9.8\%, 7.7\%, 5.6\% of global watersheds, respectively. Attributing streamflow changes showed that the effects of MT and MNT on streamflow changes were mutually reinforcing in most basins. The influence of vegetation composition on streamflow changes was greater in semi-humid and arid regions than in humid regions. This research quantified the impacts of vegetation composition changes and climate change on streamflow changes worldwide and could clarify the hydrological responses to changing environments.},

  abstract = {The increasing threats of flash floods and water scarcity in semi-arid regions necessitate high-quality streamflow forecasting with process-based or data-driven models. However, temporal heterogeneity of hydrological patterns and infrequent flood events present challenges for accurate streamflow forecasting. To address this issue, we purpose an effective modeling approach that combines a novel data segmentation method, BPX, with an attention-based deep learning (DL) model. BPX integrates Bai-Perron analysis and XGBoost to accurately identify dry and wet periods from hydro-meteorological variables both in the past and future times. The DL model introduces an attention mechanism to temporal convolutional network (TCN) to enhance its ability in handling heterogeneous time-series data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using nearly 20~years of hydro-meteorological data from the Wei River basin in China. Various modeling methods are compared, including two process-based models (Xinanjiang and GR4J) and four DL models (classical RNN, GRU, LSTM and TCN) with or without the attention module. After systematic benchmarking, it is found that both the BPX segmentation and the attention mechanism can improve streamflow forecasting with DL. Among the various modeling approaches, BPX-TCN exhibits the best overall performance throughout the prediction period, achieving the highest Kling-Gupta efficiency of 0.91 (compared to 0.45--0.88 for the other models), while BPX-TCN-attention provides more accurate predictions of floods and multi-step predictions. In similar applications in semi-arid regions, our approach may serve as a valuable reference where temporal heterogeneity is significant and poses challenges to traditional modeling methods.},

The DBHM embeds a biosphere model into a distributed hydrological scheme, representing both topography and vegetation in a mesoscale hydrological simulation, and the model system includes an irrigation scheme. The authors investigated the effects of two kinds of variability, precipitation variability and the variability of irrigation redistributing runoff, representing natural and anthropogenic heterogeneity, respectively, on hydrological processes. Runoff was underestimated if rainfall was placed spatially uniformly over large grid cells. Accounting for precipitation heterogeneity improved the runoff simulation. However, the negative runoff contribution, namely, the situation that mean annual precipitation is less than evapotranspiration, cannot be simulated by only considering the natural heterogeneity. This constructive model shortcoming can be eliminated by accounting for anthropogenic heterogeneity caused by irrigation water withdrawals. Irrigation leads to increased evapotranspiration and decreased runoff, and surface soil moisture in irrigated areas increases because of irrigation. Simulations performed for the Yellow River basin of China indicated streamflow decreases of 41\% due to irrigation effects. The latent heat flux in the peak irrigation season [June--August (JJA)] increased 3.3 W m-2 with a decrease in the ground surface temperature of 0.1 K for the river basin. The maximum simulated increase in the latent heat flux was 43 W m-2, and the ground temperature decrease was 1.6 K in the peak irrigation season.},

Results show that the occurrence frequency of global precipitation whiplash is projected to be 2.56\,{\textpm}\,0.16 times higher than in 1979--2019 by the end of the 21st Century, with increasingly rapid and intense transitions between two extremes. The most dramatic increases of whiplash show in the polar and monsoon regions. Changes in precipitation whiplash show a much higher percentage change than precipitation totals. In historical simulations, anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) and aerosol emissions have increased and decreased precipitation whiplash occurrences, respectively. By 2079, anthropogenic GHGs are projected to increase 55\,{\textpm}\,4\% of the occurrences risk of precipitation whiplash, which is driven by shifts in circulation patterns conducive to precipitation extremes.},

Choosing an appropriate dataset for a given application is therefore not a simple task. This study compares nine global/nearglobal precipitation datasets and three global temperature datasets over 3138 North American catchments. The chosen datasets all meet the minimum requirement of having at least 30 years of available data, so they could all potentially be used as reference datasets for climate change impact studies. The precipitation datasets include two gauged-only products (GPCC and CPC-Unified), two satellite products corrected using ground-based observations (CHIRPS V2.0 and PERSIANN-CDR V1R1), four reanalysis products (NCEP CFSR, JRA55, ERA-Interim, and ERA5), and one merged product (MSWEP V1.2). The temperature datasets include one gauge-based (CPC-Unified) and two reanalysis (ERAInterim and ERA5) products. High-resolution gauge-based gridded precipitation and temperature datasets were combined as the reference dataset for this intercomparison study. To assess dataset performance, all combinations were used as inputs to a lumped hydrological model. The results showed that all temperature datasets performed similarly, albeit with the CPC performance being systematically inferior to that of the other three. Significant differences in performance were, however, observed between the precipitation datasets. The MSWEP dataset performed best, followed by the gauge-based, reanalysis, and satellite datasets categories. Results also showed that gauge-based datasets should be preferred in regions with good weather network density, but CHIRPS and ERA5 would be good alternatives in data-sparse regions.},

New hydrological insights for the region The multi-criteria based model comparison shows that the simple conceptual models performed best in smaller watersheds for reproducing observed streamflow in the time domain, whereas the complex model performed best for the largest watershed. For reproducing observed streamflow in the quantile domain, the simple conceptual models performed best for simulation of high, moist, mid-range, and dry-flows in the Gilgelabay watershed; of dry and low-flows in the Gummera and Megech watersheds; and of high flows in the Ribb watershed. For the remaining flow ranges of each watershed, the complex model performed better. This study also addressed the sensitivity of the complex model for the number of partitioned subbasins. In the largest watershed, the performance of the complex model improved when the number of partitioned subbasins was increased. This finding indicates that the distributed models are especially applicable for the complex watershed because of its physical heterogeneity. In general, integrating these three models may be suitable for water resources assessment.},

The objective of this study is to obtain better understanding of water balance dynamics of upper Blue Nile catchments on annual and monthly time scales and on a spatial scale of meso scale to large scale. The water balance analysis using a Budyko-type curve at annual scale reveals that the aridity index does not exert a first order control in most of the catchments. This implies the need to increase model complexity to monthly time scale to include the effects of seasonal soil moisture dynamics. The dynamic water balance model used in this study predicts the direct runoff and other processes based on the limit concept; i.e. for dry environments since rainfall amount is small, the aridity index approaches to infinity or equivalently evaporation approaches rainfall and for wet environments where the rainfall amount is large, the aridity index approaches to zero and actual evaporation approaches the potential evaporation. The uncertainty of model parameters has been assessed using the GLUE (Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation) methodology. The results show that the majority of the parameters are reasonably well identifiable. However, the baseflow recession constant was poorly identifiable. Parameter uncertainty and model structural errors could be the reason for the poorly identifiable parameter. Moreover, a multi-objective model calibration strategy has been employed to emphasize the different aspects of the hydrographs on low and high flows. The model has been calibrated and validated against observed streamflow time series and it shows good performance for the twenty study catchments in the upper Blue Nile. During the calibration period (1995-2000) the Nash and Sutcliffe efficiency (ENS) for monthly flow prediction varied between 0.52 to 0.93 (dominated by high flows), while it varied between 0.32 to 0.90 using logarithms of flow series (indicating the goodness of low flow simulations). The model is parsimonious and it is suggested that the calibrated parameters could be used after some more regionalization efforts to predict monthly stream flows in ungauged catchments of the Upper Blue Nile basin, which is the vast majority of catchments in that region.},

  abstract = {Since the 1950s, Europe has undergone large shifts in climate and land cover. Previous assessments of past and future changes in evapotranspiration or streamflow have either focussed on land use/cover or climate contributions or on individual catchments under specific climate conditions, but not on all aspects at larger scales. Here, we aim to understand how decadal changes in climate (e.g. precipitation, temperature) and land use (e.g. deforestation/afforestation, urbanization) have impacted the amount and distribution of water resource availability (both evapotranspiration and streamflow) across Europe since the 1950s. To this end, we simulate the distribution of average evapotranspiration and stream-flow at high resolution (1 km(2)) by combining (a) a steady-state Budyko model for water balance partitioning constrained by long-term (lysimeter) observations across different land use types, (b) a novel decadal high-resolution historical land use reconstruction, and (c) gridded observations of key meteorological variables. The continental-scale patterns in the simulations agree well with coarser-scale observation-based estimates of evapotranspiration and also with observed changes in streamflow from small basins across Europe. We find that strong shifts in the continental-scale patterns of evapotranspiration and streamflow have occurred between the period around 1960 and 2010. In much of central-western Europe, our results show an increase in evapotranspiration of the order of 5 \%-15 \% between 1955-1965 and 2005-2015, whereas much of the Scandinavian peninsula shows increases exceeding 15 \%. The Iberian Peninsula and other parts of the Mediterranean show a decrease of the order of 5 \%-15 \%. A similar north- south gradient was found for changes in streamflow, although changes in central-western Europe were generally small. Strong decreases and increases exceeding 45 \% were found in parts of the Iberian and Scandinavian peninsulas, respectively. In Sweden, for example, increased precipitation is a larger driver than large-scale reforestation and afforestation, leading to increases in both streamflow and evapotranspiration. In most of the Mediterranean, decreased precipitation combines with increased forest cover and potential evapotranspiration to reduce streamflow. In spite of considerable local- and regional-scale complexity, the response of net actual evapotranspiration to changes in land use, precipitation, and potential evaporation is remarkably uniform across Europe, increasing by similar to 35-60 km(3) yr(-1), equivalent to the discharge of a large river. For streamflow, effects of changes in precipitation (similar to 95 km(3) yr(-1)) dominate land use and potential evapotranspiration contributions (similar to 45-60 km(3) yr(-1)). Locally, increased forest cover, forest stand age, and urbanization have led to significant decreases and increases in available streamflow, even in catchments that are considered to be near-natural.},

To deal with these biases, several bias correction methods have been developed recently, ranging from simple scaling to rather sophisticated approaches. This paper provides a review of available bias correction methods and demonstrates how they can be used to correct for deviations in an ensemble of 11 different RCM-simulated temperature and precipitation series. The performance of all methods was assessed in several ways: At first, differently corrected RCM data was compared to observed climate data. The second evaluation was based on the combined influence of corrected RCM-simulated temperature and precipitation on hydrological simulations of monthly mean streamflow as well as spring and autumn flood peaks for five catchments in Sweden under current (1961-1990) climate conditions. Finally, the impact on hydrological simulations based on projected future (2021-2050) climate conditions was compared for the different bias correction methods. Improvement of uncorrected RCM climate variables was achieved with all bias correction approaches. While all methods were able to correct the mean values, there were clear differences in their ability to correct other statistical properties such as standard deviation or percentiles. Simulated streamflow characteristics were sensitive to the quality of driving input data: Simulations driven with bias-corrected RCM variables fitted observed values better than simulations forced with uncorrected RCM climate variables and had more narrow variability bounds.

Climate changes are modelled by the HIRHAM regional climate model on the basis of the IPCC A2 scenario. A hydrological model (NAM) is used to convert precipitation to river discharges. Difficulties are found in the direct use of climate model generated precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (reference evaporation) because of too many rainy days, deviations from mean annual values of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration from observed values, and poor agreement on seasonality. Therefore climate model generated data is corrected to match observed mean annual values and the mean monthly distribution. Mean annual precipitation is found to increase 7\%, potential evapotranspiration to increase 3\% and river discharges to increase 12\% on average, between a control period (1961--1990) and the future period. Because of increased precipitation from October to March and reduced precipitation from July to September the monthly river discharges are found to increase from December to August and decrease in September and October. Extreme values of precipitation and river discharge are examined and the level of the highest precipitation and the highest river discharge events are estimated to increase. The precipitation amount exceeded 0.1\% of all days increases by an average of 7\%, the river discharge exceeded 0.1\% of all days increases approximately 15\%. The 100-year flood is modelled to increase 11\% on average.},

  abstract = {Given the important role of Atmospheric River precipitation (ARP) in the global hydrological cycle, accurate representation of ARP is significant. However, general circulation models (GCMs) demonstrate bias in simulating ARP. The target of this study is to quantify the performance of ARP intensity/frequency for CMIP6 simulations, and further to improve ARP estimation of CMIP6 using Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) with highlighting the more accurate ARP features under the global warming background. The findings of this study are as follows: (a) although ARP intensity/frequency in reserved-optimal CMIP6 overall reproduces the observation, it is still underestimated at the stronger Atmospheric river (AR) scales, particularly for the AR highly active mid-latitude regions. (b) The CycleGAN-based bias correction approach markedly diminishes the bias of the CMIP6 simulations within most of the AR scales among both global and the four AR highly active regions. Moreover, the performance of the ARP in AR highly active regions is significant improvement, which is mainly due to the reduction of the bias at the strongest scale. (c) Relative to reference period (1986-2005), ARP intensity/frequency at the strongest scale increase notably under 3 degrees C warming level, with an average value of 373.3\% in intensity and 415.9\% in frequency for global and the four key regions before correction, and the value is 451.9\% and 492.5\% after bias correction. The results illustrate that CycleGAN can effectively improve the ARP simulations of GCMs, and an early warning implies that future strong extreme ARP should potentially surpass the current expected. Despite the important role of Atmospheric River precipitation (ARP) in global hydrological cycle, accurately simulating global ARP remains a great challenge. Here, the content of our study consists of three main parts. Firstly, we quantify the performance of CMIP6 general circulation models (GCMs) on ARP intensity/frequency simulations and find that CMIP6 GCMs underestimates ARP at the Atmospheric river (AR) highly active regions, especially in the strongest AR intensity scale. Secondly, we utilize a deep learning method named CycleGAN to improve global ARP intensity/frequency simulations of CMIP6 GCMs. The results indicate that CycleGAN effectively corrects the ARP intensity/frequency bias within most of the AR intensity scales among both global and the AR highly active regions. Moreover, the performance of ARP in the AR highly active regions is significant improvement, which is mainly due to the reduction of the bias in the strongest scale. Finally, the trained CycleGAN model is used to evaluate ARP under global warming of 1.5, 2, and 3 degrees. The bias correction results show that ARP in the strongest AR intensity scale surpasses the current expected, especially under 3 degrees warming level. CMIP6 models underestimates Atmospheric River precipitation (ARP) at the Atmospheric river (AR) highly active regions, especially in the strongest AR scale The CycleGAN-based deep learning method reduces model bias notably for ARP intensity and frequency, respectively ARP in the strongest AR scale potentially surpasses the current GCM-based projections expected in different degrees of warming after bias correction},

  abstract = {Alpine areas play a substantial role in supplying the world's water resources. The hydrological cycle in these areas has been experiencing notable alterations owing to climate change. However, the present comprehension of how water yield capacity (WYC) responds to climate change at varying elevations within alpine basins is impeded due to the complex terrain and simplified representation of coupled water-energy processes in traditional hydrological models. Through integrating the Weather Research and Forecasting hydrological modeling system (WRF-Hydro) and Budyko framework, this study quantitatively assessed the influence of climate change on WYC across different elevations in a Tibetan Plateau alpine basin, named Xiying River Basin (XRB). The results indicated the WRF-Hydro adeptly reproduced the streamflow and evapotranspiration (ET) within the XRB. The combination of the WRF-Hydro model allows the Budyko framework, traditionally limited to the watershed scale, to be applicable at the grid scale. We found that the XRB underwent substantial climate change from 1980 to 2015, and there existed an abrupt change in 1997. Climate change caused the WYC reduced by -17.06\% during the post-1997 period (1998--2015), compared to the pre-1997 period (1980--1997). Additionally, all elevation bands displayed the WYC reductions, ranging from -3.69\% to -24.31\%, with diminishing magnitude at higher elevations. This WYC reduction is primarily attributed to an increase of 11.38\% in ET. Although ET and precipitation increased with elevation, the former consistently exceeded the latter, resulting in decreasing water deficits and an altitudinal gradient of the WYC reduction. Besides the increasing vapor pressure deficit and decreasing albedo, our findings emphasized the significance of precipitation event timing in influencing WYC. The longer time intervals between precipitation events in the XRB led to more soil moisture loss through ET. These findings shed valuable implications for policymakers, offering guidance for the formulation of sustainable policies for water resource management and ecological conservation.},

  abstract = {Free water storage capacity, an important characteristic of land surface related to runoff process, has a significant influence on runoff generation and separation. It is thus necessary to derive reasonable spatial distribution of free water storage capacity for rainfall-runoff simulation, especially in distributed modeling. In this paper, a topographic index based approach is proposed for the derivation of free water storage capacity spatial distribution. The topographic index, which can be obtained from digital elevation model (DEM), are used to establish a functional relationship with free water storage capacity in the proposed approach. In this case, the spatial variability of free water storage capacity can be directly estimated from the characteristics of watershed topography. This approach was tested at two medium sized watersheds, including Changhua and Chenhe, with the drainage areas of 905 km2 and 1395 km2, respectively. The results show that locations with larger values of free water storage capacity generally correspond to locations with higher topographic index values, such as riparian region. The estimated spatial distribution of free water storage capacity is also used in a distributed, grid-based Xinanjiang model to simulate 10 flood events for Chenhe Watershed and 17 flood events for Changhua Watershed. Our analysis indicates that the proposed approach based on topographic index can produce reasonable spatial variability of free water storage capacity and is more suitable for flood simulation.},

  abstract = {Choosing downscaling techniques is crucial in obtaining accurate and reliable climate change predictions, allowing for detailed impact assessments of climate change at regional and local scales. Traditional statistical methods are likely inefficient in downscaling precipitation data from multiple sources or complex data patterns, so using deep learning, a form of nonlinear models, could be a promising solution. In this study, we proposed to use deep learning models, the so-called long short-term memory and feedforward neural network methods, for precipitation downscaling for the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Model performances were assessed for 2036--2065 period, using original climate projections from five climate models under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, for two Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). The results exhibited that there were good correlations between the modelled and observed values of the testing and validating periods at two long-term meteorological stations (Can Tho and Chau Doc). We then analysed extreme indices of precipitation, including the annual maximum wet day frequency (Prcp), 95th percentile of precipitation (P95p), maximum 5-day consecutive rain (R5d), total number of wet days (Ptot), wet day precipitation (SDII) and annual maximum dry day frequency (Pcdd) to evaluate changes in extreme precipitation events. All the five models under the two scenarios predicted that precipitation would increase in the wet season (June--October) and decrease in the dry season (November--May) in the future compared to the present-day scenario. On average, the means of multiannual wet season precipitation would increase by 20.4 and 25.4\% at Can Tho and Chau Doc, respectively, but in the dry season, these values were projected to decrease by 10 and 5.3\%. All the climate extreme indices would increase in the period of 2036--2065 in comparison to the baseline. Overall, the developed downscaling models can successfully reproduce historical rainfall patterns and downscale projected precipitation data.},

  abstract = {There is a direct influence of global warming on precipitation. Increased heating leads to greater evaporation and thus surface drying, thereby increasing the intensity and duration of drought. However, the water holding capacity of air increases by about 7\% per 1 C warming, which leads to increased water vapor in the atmosphere. Hence, storms, whether individual thunderstorms, extratropical rain or snow storms, or tropical cyclones, supplied with increased moisture, produce more intense precipitation events. Such events are observed to be widely occurring, even where total precipitation is decreasing: 'it never rains but it pours!' This increases the risk of flooding. The atmospheric and surface energy budget plays a critical role in the hydrological cycle, and also in the slower rate of change that occurs in total precipitation than total column water vapor. With modest changes in winds, patterns of precipitation do not change much, but result in dry areas becoming drier (generally throughout the subtropics) and wet areas becoming wetter, especially in the mid-to high latitudes: the 'rich get richer and the poor get poorer'. This pattern is simulated by climate models and is projected to continue into the future. Because, with warming, more precipitation occurs as rain instead of snow and snow melts earlier, there is increased runoff and risk of flooding in early spring, but increased risk of drought in summer, especially over continental areas. However, with more precipitation per unit of upward motion in the atmosphere, i.e. 'more bang for the buck', atmospheric circulation weakens, causing monsoons to falter. In the tropics and subtropics, precipitation patterns are dominated by shifts as sea surface temperatures change, with El Nino a good example. The volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 led to an unprecedented drop in land precipitation and runoff, and to widespread drought, as precipitation shifted from land to oceans and evaporation faltered, providing lessons for possible geoengineering. Most models simulate precipitation that occurs prematurely and too often, and with insufficient intensity, resulting in recycling that is too large and a lifetime of moisture in the atmosphere that is too short, which affects runoff and soil moisture.},

These seven indicators are a subset of the existing set of essential climate variables (ECVs) established by the Global Climate Observing System and are intended to provide the most essential parameters representing the state of the climate system. These indicators include global mean surface temperature, global ocean heat content, state of ocean acidification, glacier mass balance, Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extent, global CO               2               mole fraction, and global mean sea level. This paper describes how well each of these indicators are currently monitored, including the number and quality of the underlying datasets; the health of those datasets; observation systems used to estimate each indicator; the timeliness of information; and how well recent values can be linked to preindustrial conditions. These aspects vary widely between indicators. While global mean surface temperature is available in close to real time and changes from preindustrial levels can be determined with relatively low uncertainty, this is not the case for many other indicators. Some indicators (e.g., sea ice extent) are largely dependent on satellite data only available in the last 40 years, while some (e.g., ocean acidification) have limited underlying observational bases, and others (e.g., glacial mass balance) with data only available a year or more in arrears.},

This study investigated the performance of improved CMIP6 over those of CMIP5 with respect to precipitation and flood representations in the Mekong River Basin (MRB). The correlation and error comparison from the referenced precipitation exhibited a significant improvement in the peak value representation. Hence, the impacts of climate change on future floods in the MRB were simulated and assessed using a distributed rainfall-runoff-inundation model. New hydrological insights for the region: The results indicated that precipitation from CMIP6 had a higher correlation and a lower error coefficient than CMIP5. Similarly, the simulation of GCM ensembles of monthly discharge from CMIP6 exhibited a comparable average value to the observations, whereas CMIP5 underestimated the discharge simulations. The performance of the mean annual peak discharge improved from 37,220 m(3)/s (CMIP5) to 45,423 m(3)/s (CMIP6) compared to 43,521 m(3)/s (observation). The projections of future floods in the MRB from CMIP6 exhibited an increase of annual peak discharge at Chiang Saen, Vientiane, Pakse, and Kratie stations by 10-15\%, 20-22\%, and 24-29\% for the SSP2-4.5 scenario, and 10-18\%, 24-29\%, and 41-54\% for the SSP5-8.5 scenario in the near future (2026-2050), mid-future (2051-2075), and far future (2076-2100), respectively.

Noise color at the daily scale is influenced by stream network position, and land use and water management explain around one third of the spatial variation in noise color irrespective of the timescale considered.

  abstract = {Potential evaporation (E-P) is an important concept that has been extensively used in hydrology, climate, agriculture and many other relevant fields. However, E-P estimates using conventional approaches generally do not conform with the underlying idea of E-P, since meteorological forcing variables observed under real conditions are not necessarily equivalent to those over a hypothetical surface with an unlimited water supply. Here, we estimate E-P using a recently developed ocean surface evaporation model (i.e., the maximum evaporation model) that explicitly acknowledges the inter-dependence between evaporation, surface temperature (T-s) and radiation such that is able to recover radiation and T-s to a hypothetical wet surface. We first test the maximum evaporation model over land by validating its evaporation estimates with evaporation observations under unstressed conditions at 86 flux sites and found an overall good performance. We then apply the maximum evaporation model to the entire terrestrial surfaces under both wet and dry conditions to estimate E-P. The mean annual (1979-2019) global land E-P from the maximum evaporation model (E-P\_max) is 1,272 mm yr(-1), which is 11.2\% higher than that estimated using the widely adopted Priestley-Taylor model (E-P\_PT). The difference between E-P\_max and E-P\_PT is negligible in humid regions or under wet conditions but becomes increasingly larger as the surface moisture availability decreases. This difference is primarily caused by increased net radiation (R-n) when restoring the dry surfaces to hypothetical wet surfaces, despite a lower T-s obtained under hypothetical wet conditions in the maximum evaporation model.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the behavior of hydrological snow accounting routines (SARs) used in combination with hydrological models to simulate streamflow at the catchment scale. To reach conclusions as general as possible, we compare the performance of six existing SARs combined with two different precipitation-runoff models. The SARs are temperature-based, have different levels of complexity (understood here as the number of optimized parameters and model functions), include various processes and also differ by the way they account for the spatial heterogeneity of snow cover. The SARs were tested on a set of 380 catchments significantly affected by snow and located in four countries (France, Switzerland, Sweden and Canada), showing different climatic conditions and altitude ranges. The value of each SAR is evaluated solely in terms of flow simulation quality at the catchment outlet. Several efficiency criteria are used, some of them specifically focusing on the time periods affected by snow accumulation and melt. As expected, the use of a snow accounting routine on snow-affected catchments significantly improves model efficiency, and this is true even for the simplest SARs. More interestingly, our results show that the most complex SAR does not yield the highest performance. Surprisingly, a lumped routine (i.e. without distribution in elevation bands) appears to be the most efficient on average on the whole catchment set. Results seem particularly sensitive to the spatial variability of processes in the snowpack and to the determination of the precipitation phase (solid or liquid). One critical point remains the identification of the solid precipitation correction factor necessary to compensate for snowfall measurement errors. In the companion article, we further investigate the sensitivity of model results to the description of snow processes in the SAR and try to identify the most important components of a parsimonious and general SAR.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the degree of complexity required in a snow accounting routine to ultimately simulate flows at the catchment outlet. We present a simple, parsimonious and general snow accounting routine (SAR), called Cemaneige, that can be associated with any precipitation-runoff model to simulate discharge at the catchment scale. To get results of general applicability, this SAR was tested on a large set of 380 catchments from four countries (France, Switzerland, Sweden and Canada) and combined with four different hydrological models. Our results show that five basic features provide a good reliability and robustness to the SAR, namely considering: (1) a transition range of temperature for the determination of the solid fraction of precipitation; (2) five altitudinal bands of equal area for snow accumulation; (3) the cold-content of the snowpack (with a parameter controlling snowpack inertia); (4) a degree-day factor controlling snowmelt; (5) uneven snow distribution in each band. This general SAR includes two internal states (the snowpack and its cold-content). Results also indicate that only two free parameters (snowmelt factor and cold-content factor) are warranted in a SAR at the daily time step and that further complexity is not supported by improvements in flow simulation efficiency. To justify the reasons for considering the five features above, a sensitivity analysis comparing Cemaneige with other SAR versions is performed. It analyses the snow processes which should be selected or not to bring significant improvement in model performances. Compared with the six existing SARs presented in the companion article (Val{\'e}ry et al., 2014) on the 380 catchments set, Cemaneige shows better performance on average than five of these six SARs. It provides performance similar to the sixth SAR (MORD4) but with only half its number of free parameters. However, CemaNeige still appears perfectible on mountainous catchments (France and Switzerland) where the lumped SAR, MORD4, outperforms Cemaneige. Cemaneige can easily be adapted for simulation on ungauged catchments: fixing its two parameters to default values much less degrades performances than the other best performing SAR. This may partly due to the Cemaneige parsimony.},

  abstract = {Surface fresh water (i.e., blue water) is a vital and indispensable resource for human water use in the agricultural, industrial, and domestic sectors. In this paper, global water availability is calculated by forcing the global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB with daily global meteorological fields for the period 1958--2001. To represent blue water availability, a prognostic reservoir operation scheme was included in order to produce monthly time series of global river discharge modulated by reservoir operations. To specify green water availability for irrigated areas, actual transpiration from the model was used. Thus, the computed water availability reflects the climatic variability over 1958--2001 and is contrasted against the monthly water demand using the year 2000 as a benchmark in the companion paper. As the water that is withdrawn to meet demand directly interferes with blue water availability along the drainage network, this paper evaluates model performance for three regimes reflecting different degrees of human interference: natural discharge, discharge regulated by reservoirs, and modified discharge. In the case of modified discharge, the net blue water demand for the year 2000 is subtracted directly from the regulated discharge, taking water demand equal to consumptive water use. Results show that model simulations of monthly river discharge compare well with observations from most of the large rivers. Exceptions are basins subject to large extractions for irrigation purposes, where simulated discharge exceeds the observations even when water demand is taken into account. Including the prognostic reservoir operation scheme results in mixed performance, with a poorer approximation of peak flows but with a marginally better simulation of low flows and persistence. A comparison of simulated actual evapotranspiration with that from the ERA-40 reanalysis as a proxy for observed rates shows similar patterns over nonirrigated areas but substantial deviations over major irrigated areas. As expected, assimilated actual evapotranspiration over these areas includes water from alternative sources, whereas the simulations with PCR-GLOBWB are limited by soil moisture, i.e., green water availability. On the basis of this evidence we conclude that the simulation provides adequate fields of water availability to assess water stress at the monthly scale, for which a separate validation is provided in the companion paper.},

  abstract = {AbstractChanges in river discharge and river water quality, due to climate change and other drivers such as land cover change, pose both societal and ecosystem threats. Analyses of measured terrestrial river fluxes are key for identifying the drivers and quantifying the magnitudes of such riverine changes. In this paper, we develop and apply a data-driven regionalization approach using the dense network of discharge measurements in Sweden. The developed regionalization approach facilitates detailed mapping of discharges (Q) and change trends in Q across Sweden. Combining these with estimates of precipitation (P) and change trends in P, we estimated actual evapotranspiration (AET) and change trends in AET via catchment-scale water balance constraints. We identified characteristic land cover?evapotranspiration relationships by plotting water use efficiency (AET/P) against energy use efficiency (AET/potential ET) for areas with unique land cover across Sweden. Our results show that wetlands have clearly lower water and energy use efficiencies compared to open waters, forests, and agriculture, and that agriculture has water and energy use efficiencies closest to those of open waters. We further compared the data-driven regionalization estimates of different water balance components with estimates of regional climate models (RCMs). The RCMs do not describe well the observed change trends in Sweden. In particular, for evapotranspiration, the observed change trends are not reproduced by any of the investigated 24 RCMs.},

This analysis revealed three distinct regions: the mountains, the forests, and the areas with agriculture. Each region responded markedly different to recent climate and anthropogenic changes, and within each region, we identified the most sensitive subregions. These results highlight the need for regional differentiation in climate change adaptation strategies to protect vulnerable ecosystems and freshwater resources. Further, the Budyko curve moved systematically towards its water and energy limits, indicating augmentation of the water cycle driven by changing vegetation, climate and human interactions.

The input series are areal precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. The output is riverflow. The number of parameters, used in the description of the hydrological phenomena in the catchment, is in most cases three, sometimes four. The statistical methodology used for calibrating the models of given catchments is described; it reduces essentially to regression analysis, including residual analysis, sensitivity to calibration period and extrapolation test. In particular, automatic calibration is used, excluding subjective elements. The models are applied to 79 river basins in Belgium, China and Burma. The results are compared with four similar models taken from the literature. The results of applying the new models are satisfactory from a statistical point of view and are much better than those quoted in the literature; a greater part of the observed runoff is explained and there is no residual seasonality. This results from the different mathematical' structure of the models, and especially from the use, in the published models, of several storages with maximum 'capacities', with no distinction between slow and fast runoff corresponding to baseflow and direct runoff, respectively.},

As an alternative, flexible modelling approaches allow the identification and refinement of the model structure as part of the modelling process. In this study, twelve different conceptual model structures from the SUPERFLEX framework are compared with the fixed model structure GR4H, using a large set of 237 French catchments and discharge-based performance metrics. The results show that, in general, the flexible approach performs better than the fixed approach. However, the flexible approach has a higher chance of inconsistent results when calibrated on two different periods. When analysing the subset of 116 catchments where the two approaches produce consistent performance over multiple time periods, their average performance relative to each other is almost equivalent. From the point of view of developing a well-performing fixed model structure, the findings favour models with parallel reservoirs and a power function to describe the reservoir outflow. In general, conceptual hydrological models perform better on larger and/or wetter catchments than on smaller and/or drier catchments. The model structures performed poorly when there were large climatic differences between the calibration and validation periods, in catchments with flashy flows, and in catchments with unexplained variations in low flow measurements.},

However, several different hydrological models can be selected to simulate extreme events. A difference in hydrological model structure results in a spread in the simulation of extreme runoff events. We investigated the impact of different model structures on the magnitude and timing of simulated extreme high- and low-flow events by combining two state-of-the-art approaches: a modular modelling framework (FUSE) and large ensemble meteorological simulations. This combination of methods created the opportunity to isolate the impact of specific hydrological process formulations at long return periods without relying on statistical models. We showed that the impact of hydrological model structure was larger for the simulation of low-flow compared to high-flow events and varied between the four evaluated climate zones. In cold and temperate climate zones, the magnitude and timing of extreme runoff events were significantly affected by different parameter sets and hydrological process formulations, such as evaporation. In the arid and tropical climate zones, the impact of hydrological model structures on extreme runoff events was smaller. This novel combination of approaches provided insights into the importance of specific hydrological process formulations in different climate zones, which can support adequate model selection for the simulation of extreme runoff events.},

  abstract = {Human activity has a profound influence on river discharges, hydrological extremes and water-related hazards. In this study, we compare the results of five state-of-the-art global hydrological models (GHMs) with observations to examine the role of human impact parameterizations (HIP) in the simulation of mean, high-and low-flows. The analysis is performed for 471 gauging stations across the globe for the period 1971-2010. We find that the inclusion of HIP improves the performance of the GHMs, both in managed and near-natural catchments. For near-natural catchments, the improvement in performance results from improvements in incoming discharges from upstream managed catchments. This finding is robust across the GHMs, although the level of improvement and the reasons for it vary greatly. The inclusion of HIP leads to a significant decrease in the bias of the long-term mean monthly discharge in 36\%-73\% of the studied catchments, and an improvement in the modeled hydrological variability in 31\%-74\% of the studied catchments. Including HIP in the GHMs also leads to an improvement in the simulation of hydrological extremes, compared to when HIP is excluded. Whilst the inclusion of HIP leads to decreases in the simulated high-flows, it can lead to either increases or decreases in the low-flows. This is due to the relative importance of the timing of return flows and reservoir operations as well as their associated uncertainties. Even with the inclusion of HIP, we find that the model performance is still not optimal. This highlights the need for further research linking human management and hydrological domains, especially in those areas in which human impacts are dominant. The large variation in performance between GHMs, regions and performance indicators, calls for a careful selection of GHMs, model components and evaluation metrics in future model applications.},

  abstract = {A wealth of remotely sensed image time series covering large areas is now available to the earth science community. Change detection methods are often not capable of detecting land cover changes within time series that are heavily influenced by seasonal climatic variations. Detecting change within the trend and seasonal components of time series enables the classification of different types of changes. Changes occurring in the trend component often indicate disturbances (e.g. fires, insect attacks), while changes occurring in the seasonal component indicate phenological changes (e.g. change in land cover type). A generic change detection approach is proposed for time series by detecting and characterizing Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST). BFAST integrates the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting change within time series. BFAST iteratively estimates the time and number of changes, and characterizes change by its magnitude and direction. We tested BFAST by simulating 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series with varying amounts of seasonality and noise, and by adding abrupt changes at different times and magnitudes. This revealed that BFAST can robustly detect change with different magnitudes ({$>$} 0.1 NDVI) within time series with different noise levels (0.01-0.07 sigma) and seasonal amplitudes (0.1-0.5 NDVI). Additionally, BFAST was applied to 16-day NDVI Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) composites for a forested study area in south eastern Australia. This showed that BFAST is able to detect and characterize spatial and temporal changes in a forested landscape. BFAST is not specific to a particular data type and can be applied to time series without the need to normalize for land cover types, select a reference period, or change trajectory. The method can be integrated within monitoring frameworks and used as an alarm system to flag when and where changes occur. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A challenge in phenology studies is understanding what constitutes phenological change amidst background variation. The majority of phenological studies have focused on extracting critical points in the seasonal growth cycle, without exploiting the full temporal detail. The high degree of phenological variability between years demonstrates the necessity of distinguishing long-term phenological change from temporal variability. Here, we demonstrate the phenological change detection ability of a method for detecting change within time series. BFAST, Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend, integrates the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting change. We tested BFAST by simulating 16-day NDVI time series with varying amounts of seasonal amplitude and noise, containing abrupt disturbances (e.g. fires) and long-term phenological changes. This revealed that the method is able to detect the timing of phenological changes within time series while accounting for abrupt disturbances and noise. Results showed that the phenological change detection is influenced by the signal-to-noise ratio of the time series. Between different land cover types the seasonal amplitude varies and determines the signal-to-noise ratio, and as such the capacity to differentiate phenological changes from noise. Application of the method on 16-day NDVI MODIS images from 2000 until 2009 for a forested study area in south eastern Australia confirmed these results. It was shown that a minimum seasonal amplitude of 0.1 NDVI is required to detect phenological change within cleaned MODIS NDVI time series using the quality flags. BFAST identifies phenological change independent of phenological metrics by exploiting the full time series. The method is globally applicable since it analyzes each pixel individually without the setting of thresholds to detect change within a time series. Longterm phenological changes can be detected within NDVI time series of a large range of land cover types (e.g. grassland, woodlands and deciduous forests) having a seasonal amplitude larger than the noise level. The method can be applied to any time series data and it is not necessarily limited to NDVI. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Near real-time monitoring of ecosystem disturbances is critical for rapidly assessing and addressing impacts on carbon dynamics, biodiversity, and socio-ecological processes. Satellite remote sensing enables cost-effective and accurate monitoring at frequent time steps over large areas. Yet, generic methods to detect disturbances within newly captured satellite images are lacking. We propose a multi-purpose time-series-based disturbance detection approach that identifies and models stable historical variation to enable change detection within newly acquired data. Satellite image time series of vegetation greenness provide a global record of terrestrial vegetation productivity over the past decades. Here, we assess and demonstrate the method by applying it to (1) simulated time series of vegetation greenness data from satellite data, (2) real-world satellite greenness image time series between February 2000 and July 2011 covering Somalia to detect drought-related vegetation disturbances. First, simulation results illustrate that disturbances are successfully detected in near real-time while being robust to seasonality and noise. Second, major drought-related disturbance corresponding with most drought-stressed regions in Somalia are detected from mid-2010 onwards. The method can analyse in-situ or satellite data time series of biophysical indicators from local to global scale since it is fast, does not depend on thresholds and does not require time series gap filling. While the data and methods used are appropriate for proof-of-concept development of global scale disturbance monitoring, specific applications (e.g., drought or deforestation monitoring) mandate integration within an operational monitoring framework (e.g., http://www.fews.net/).

  abstract = {We evaluated the response of the Earth land biomes to drought by correlating a drought index with three global indicators of vegetation activity and growth: vegetation indices from satellite imagery, treering growth series, and Aboveground Net Primary Production (ANPP) records. Arid and humid biomes are both affected by drought, and we suggest that the persistence of the water deficit (i.e., the drought time-scale) could be playing a key role in determining the sensitivity of land biomes to drought. We found that arid biomes respond to drought at short time-scales; that is, there is a rapid vegetation reaction as soon as water deficits below normal conditions occur. This may be due to the fact that plant species of arid regions have mechanisms allowing them to rapidly adapt to changing water availability. Humid biomes also respond to drought at short time-scales, but in this case the physiological mechanisms likely differ from those operating in arid biomes, as plants usually have a poor adaptability to water shortage. On the contrary, semiarid and subhumid biomes respond to drought at long time-scales, probably because plants are able to withstand water deficits, but they lack the rapid response of arid biomes to drought. These results are consistent among three vegetation parameters analyzed and across different land biomes, showing that the response of vegetation to drought depends on characteristic drought time-scales for each biome. Understanding the dominant time-scales at which drought most influences vegetation might help assessing the resistance and resilience of vegetation and improving our knowledge of vegetation vulnerability to climate change.},

The number of summer days (when daily maximum temperature {$>$}25{$^\circ$}C) has increased at most locations south of 65{$^\circ$}N, and the number of hot days (daily maximum temperature {$>$}30{$^\circ$}C) and hot nights (daily minimum temperature {$>$}22{$^\circ$}C) have increased at a few stations in the most southerly regions. Very warm temperatures in both summer and winter (represented by the 95th percentile of their daily maximum and minimum temperatures, respectively) have increased across the country, with stronger trends in winter. Warming is more pronounced for cold temperatures. The frost-free season has become longer with fewer frost days, consecutive frost days, and ice days. Very cold temperatures in both winter and summer (represented by the 5th percentile of their daily maximum and minimum temperatures, respectively) have increased substantially across the country, again with stronger trends in the winter. Changes in other temperature indices are consistent with warming. The growing season is now longer, and the number of growing degree-days has increased. The number of heating degree-days has decreased across the country, while the number of cooling degree-days has increased at many stations south of 55{$^\circ$}N. The frequency of annual and spring freeze--thaw days shows an increase in the interior provinces and a decrease in the remainder of the country. Changes in precipitation indices are less spatially coherent. An increase in the number of days with rainfall and heavy rainfall is found at several locations in the south. A decrease in the number of days with snowfall and heavy snowfall is observed in the western provinces, while an increase is found in the north. There is no evidence of significant changes in the annual highest 1-day rainfall and 1-day snowfall. The maximum number of consecutive dry days has decreased, mainly in the south.},

  abstract = {A coupled water balance and water transport model (WBM/WTM) was constructed as part of a larger study of global biogeochemistry. The WBM/WTM provides critical hydrologic information to models of terrestrial primary production, organic matter decay, riverine nutrient flux and trace gas exchanges with the troposphere. Specifically, it creates high-resolution data sets for monthly soil moisture, evapotranspiration, runoff, river discharge and floodplain inundation. As a first step toward eventual global coverage, the WBM/WTM was applied to South America, represented by more than 5700 1/2 degrees (latitude/longitude) grid cells. The WBM transforms spatially complex data on long-term climate, vegetation, soils and topography into predictions of soil moisture (SM), evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff (RO). For South America, field capacity in soils ranged from 27 to 582 mm of water, and computed values for mean annual SM, ET and RO were 284 mm, 1059 mm/yr and 619 mm/yr, respectively. There were large differences regionally and over the year. The transport model uses WBM-derived runoff, information on fluvial topology, linear transfer through river channels and a simple representation of floodplain inundation to generate monthly discharge estimates for any cell within a simulated catchment. The WTM successfully determined the timing and magnitude of discharge at selected locations within the Amazon/Tocantins basin. It also demonstrated the importance of floodplain inundation in defining flow regime on the mainstem Amazon. Estimated mean annual discharge was 207,000 m(3)/s for the Amazon River and 17,000 m(3)/s for the Tocantins. In these basins, 45\% of the incident precipitation emerges as river flow; 55\% is lost to ET. The model described in this paper will be expanded to include the dynamics of carbon, major nutrients and sediments. It will serve as a semimechanistic tool to quantify the transport of materials from the landscape to the world's oceans. Such a capability becomes increasingly important as we seek to understand the impacts of climate and land use change on major river systems of the globe.},

  abstract = {Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have become increasingly popular for estimating the posterior probability distribution of parameters in hydrologic models. However, MCMC methods require the a priori definition of a proposal or sampling distribution, which determines the explorative capabilities and efficiency of the sampler and therefore the statistical properties of the Markov Chain and its rate of convergence. In this paper we present an MCMC sampler entitled the Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis algorithm (SCEM-UA), which is well suited to infer the posterior distribution of hydrologic model parameters. The SCEM-UA algorithm is a modified version of the original SCE-UA global optimization algorithm developed by Duan et al. [1992]. The SCEM-UA algorithm operates by merging the strengths of the Metropolis algorithm, controlled random search, competitive evolution, and complex shuffling in order to continuously update the proposal distribution and evolve the sampler to the posterior target distribution. Three case studies demonstrate that the adaptive capability of the SCEM-UA algorithm significantly reduces the number of model simulations needed to infer the posterior distribution of the parameters when compared with the traditional Metropolis-Hastings samplers.},

  abstract = {This paper assesses global water stress at a finer temporal scale compared to conventional assessments. To calculate time series of global water stress at a monthly time scale, global water availability, as obtained from simulations of monthly river discharge from the companion paper, is confronted with global monthly water demand. Water demand is defined here as the volume of water required by users to satisfy their needs. Water demand is calculated for the benchmark year of 2000 and contrasted against blue water availability, reflecting climatic variability over the period 1958--2001. Despite the use of the single benchmark year with monthly variations in water demand, simulated water stress agrees well with long-term records of observed water shortage in temperate, (sub)tropical, and (semi)arid countries, indicating that on shorter (i.e., decadal) time scales, climatic variability is often the main determinant of water stress. With the monthly resolution the number of people experiencing water scarcity increases by more than 40\% compared to conventional annual assessments that do not account for seasonality and interannual variability. The results show that blue water stress is often intense and frequent in densely populated regions (e.g., India, United States, Spain, and northeastern China). By this method, regions vulnerable to infrequent but detrimental water stress could be equally identified (e.g., southeastern United Kingdom and northwestern Russia).},

  abstract = {The prediction of streamflow at ungauged sites is one of the fundamental challenges to hydrologists today. While major progress has been made in the regionalization of statistical flow properties (e.g. extreme values), and methods for synthesis of event response at ungauged sites are widely applied, the estimation of continuous streamflow time-series is still very uncertain. The challenge of predicting the response at ungauged sites is often met through a process of parameter regionalization. Little attention has so far been given to the impact of new insights into model identification at gauged sites, e.g. regarding the problem of structural error, on this regionalization process. Questions that are addressed in this paper are the following: (1) What is the relationship between local parameter identifiability and catchment characteristics? (2) How is the uniqueness of catchments reflected in regionalization? (3) What is the result of local model structural uncertainty on the regionalization result? (4) How can we propagate local parameter uncertainty into predictions in ungauged basins and what is the result? A case study of 10 catchments located in the southeast of England is utilized to deal with these questions. The main conclusions from this study are that the uncertainty in the locally estimated model parameters is a function of their importance in representing the response of a given catchment, model structural error hinders identification of a parameter to represent a certain process and therefore hinders the regionalization, and the uncertainty in the calibrated parameters can be propagated to ungauged sites using a weighted regression approach.},

  abstract = {The transport of sediment by rivers to the oceans represents an important pathway in the global geochemical cycle, a key component of the global denudation system, and an important measure of land degradation and the associated reduction in the global soil resource. With the growth of interest in global environmental change, it is important to consider the extent to which this important index of the functioning of the earth system is changing. Evidence from longer-term sediment load records indicates that river sediment fluxes are sensitive to many influences, including reservoir construction, land clearance and land use change, other forms of land disturbance, including mining activity, soil and water conservation measures and sediment control programmes, and climate change. Some of these influences cause sediment loads to increase, whilst others, namely, soil and water conservation and sediment control programmes, and reservoir construction cause decreased sediment fluxes. In many cases, it is difficult to disentangle the influence of climate change from that of other changes in catchment condition. Although there is clear evidence that the sediment loads of some rivers are changing, others show little evidence of any significant temporal trend. This could reflect either lack of change in the controlling factors or the buffering of any change by the river basin. To provide a preliminary assessment of current trends in the sediment loads of the world's rivers, longer-term records of annual sediment load and runoff were assembled for 145 major rivers. Simple trend analysis of these data indicated that ca. 50\% of the sediment load records showed evidence of statistically significant upward or downward trends, with the majority evidencing declining loads. In the case of the annual runoff series, far fewer rivers (i.e. ca. 30\%) showed evidence of statistically significant trends. The evidence afforded by the sample of the world's rivers indicates that reservoir construction is probably the most important influence on land-ocean sediment fluxes, but the influence of other controls resulting in increasing sediment loads could also be detected. A larger database, however, is required to provide a more definitive assessment of current trends in land-ocean sediment transfer by the world's rivers. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

This study investigates the impact of non-stationary model parameters on model performance for different flow indices and time scales. Therefore, a Self-Organizing Map based optimization approach, which links non-stationary model parameters with climate indices, is presented and tested on seven meso-scale catchments in northern Germany. The algorithm automatically groups sub-periods with similar climate characteristics and allocates them to similar model parameter sets. The climate indices used for the classification of sub-periods are based on (a) yearly means and (b) a moving average over the previous 61days. Classification b supports the estimation of continuous non-stationary parameters. The results show that (i) non-stationary model parameters can improve the performance of hydrological models with an acceptable growth in parameter uncertainty; (ii) some model parameters are highly correlated to some climate indices; (iii) the model performance improves more for monthly means than yearly means; and (iv) in general low to medium flows improve more than high flows. It was further shown how the gained knowledge can be used to identify insufficiencies in the model structure. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

However, these ecosystems are under pressure from both climate and land use changes. This study aimed to analyze the effects of climate and land use changes on water yield using the Budyko framework as a first-order conceptual framework assuming steady-state for pristine/protected forested areas. For nine selected forested water towers in East Africa, the amount and distribution of water resources and their decadal changes were analyzed. Results show that most areas inside and outside the water towers are under pressure from human influences. Water yield was more sensitive to climate changes compared to land use changes within the selected East African water towers themselves. However, for the surrounding lowlands, the effects of land use changes had greater impacts on water yield. We conclude that the East African water towers have seen a strong shift towards wetter conditions, especially in the period of 2011-2019, while, at the same time, the potential evapotranspiration is gradually increasing. Given that most of the water towers were identified as non-resilient to these changes, future water yield is likely to also experience more extreme variations.},

  abstract = {The source region of the Yellow River Basin (SYRB) is an alpine region sensitive to climate changes. As global climate change intensifies, it is essential to explore the future hydrological regime alteration and its ecological effects on the basin to provide evidence for water resources management and ecological restoration in the area. This study offers a framework for assessing the future multi-dimensional hydrological regime alteration and its ecological effects. Selected from Global Climate Models (GCMs) that performed well in the Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the VIC model was forced by the GCMs after downscaling and bias-correction. Then the hydrological regime alteration and potential ecological effects in the region under SSP126, SSP245, SSP585 future scenarios were systematically assessed by the IHA-RVA system, and the contribution of different uncertainty sources was quantified through the two-way ANOVA. The results indicated that: (1) The temperature and precipitation will increase in the future under all scenarios, while the runoff tends to show a downward trend. By 2015--2100, the flow under SSP126, SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios may vary from -44.7 to 13.0~\%, -48.7 to 2.43~\%, -53.7 to 4.0~\%, respectively, when compared to the reference period (1961--1990). (2) Moderate alterations with RVA~=~33~\% will be observed in the hydrological regime in the basin under SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, and low alterations with RVA~=~26.7~\% under the SSP126 scenario. The spring discharge of the basin will decrease significantly, and the annual extreme flow is projected to decrease, but the frequency of drought and flood events will tend to increase. (3) There are multiple sources of uncertainty in predicting the future hydrological regime in the SYRB. The uncertainty due to the climate model is the dominant factor, followed by the interaction between emission scenarios and the climate model, and the average contribution to uncertainty of them is 69.5~\% and 20.8~\% respectively. The uncertainty of emission scenarios is mainly reflected in winter flow, while the climate model mainly affects the summer flow and annual maximum flow, and the uncertainty of interaction between them varies in different periods.},

Here, we use a historical atmospheric circulation-precipitation relationship to constrain future modelled wet-season precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau. Our constraint reduces precipitation increases to half of those from the unconstrained ensemble and reduces spread by around a factor of three. This constrained precipitation is used with estimated glacier melt contributions to constrain future runoff for seven rivers. We estimate runoff increases of 1.0-7.2\% at the end of the twenty-first century for global mean warming of 1.5-4 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. Because population projections diverge across basins, this runoff increase will reduce the population fraction living under water scarcity conditions in the Yangtze and Yellow basins but not in the Indus and Ganges basins, necessitating improved water security through climate change adaptation policies in these regions at higher risk.},

This study examines the variation trends in recorded runoff for the Xinshui River, a tributary of the Yellow River on the Loess Plateau, and uses hydrological simulations to investigate how climate change and human activity have contributed to those trends. Results show that the recorded runoff at the Daning station on the Xinshui River declined significantly from 1955--2008 with an abrupt change occurring in 1973. The Simplified Water Balance Model (SWBM) simulates monthly discharge well with a Nash--Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficient of 78\% and a relative error of volumetric fit (RE) of 0.32\%. Runoff depth over the catchment in 1973--2008 fell by 25.5 mm relative to the previous period, with human activity and climate change contributing 60.6\% and 39.4\% of the total runoff reduction, respectively. However, the impacts induced by climate change and human activities are both tending to increase. Therefore, efforts to improve the ecology of the Loess Plateau should give sufficient attention to the impacts of climate change and human activity.},

  abstract = {The accelerated climate warming in the Tibetan Plateau after 1997 has profound consequences in hydrology, geography, and social wellbeing. In hydrology, the change in streamflow as a result of changes in dynamic water storage that originated from glacier melt and permafrost thawing in the warming climate directly affects the available water resources for societies of the most populated nations in the world. In this study, annual streamflow recession characteristics are analyzed using daily climate and hydrological data during 1980-2015 in the Yarlung Zangbo River basin (YRB) of the southern Tibetan Plateau. The recession characteristics are examined in terms of dQ/dt = - aQ(b) and the response/sensitivity of streamflow to changes in groundwater storage. Major results show that climate warming has significantly increased the nonlinearity of the response (b) and streamflow stability [log(a)] in most subbasins of the YRB. These changes in the recession characteristics are attributed to the opposite effects of increases in the available water storage and recession timescale on the recession. Climate warming has increased subbasin water storage considerably due to more recharge from accelerated glacier melting and permafrost thawing after 1997. Meanwhile, the enlarged storage lengthens recession timescales and thereby decreases the sensitivity of discharge to storage. In the recession period when recharge diminished, increased evaporation and the decreased buffering effect of frost soils under warmer temperatures accelerate the initial recession of streamflow. By contrast, enlarged storage and lengthened recession timescales slow down the recession. While reservoir regulations in some basins have helped reduce and even reverse some of these climate warming effects, this short-term remedy can only function before the solid water storage is exhausted should the climate warming continue.},

  abstract = {Climate warming on the cryosphere could change catchment precipitation-runoff relation by additional water from glacier melting and more energy absorbed at the ground surface. These changes further alter the physical properties of the catchment. The combined effects of these changes on runoff are analyzed from upstream to downstream of the Yarlung-Zangpo River (YR) basin in southeastern Tibetan Plateau using statistical methods and a modified Budyko equation with consideration of glacier melting. Major results show that in the study period of 1980-2015 there was a jump in the mean annual temperature and precipitation around 1997. Since 1997, accelerated glacier melt and the thaw of permafrost have contributed to a nearly 80.9\% increase in surface runoff in the upstream region of the YR basin. Meanwhile, the increase of runoff in the same period in downstream areas of the basin with warm and wet climates is smaller and has been mostly from an increase in annual precipitation. Part of that increase is offset by changes in catchment properties following the warming, such as the increase in vegetation coverage. Results of runoff responses to climate change and catchment properties across different sub-basins in the YR basin and between the two time periods separated in 1997 suggest that continued warming would reduce the buffering effect of glacial and permafrost on runoff in upstream areas of the basin, shortening the runoff response time to precipitation and increasing flood and drought vulnerability of the YR basin.},

  abstract = {The runoff of many rivers in arid and semi-arid regions around the world has decreased remarkably with climate change and enhanced human activities, causing severe challenges in water resources utilization and ecological development. The runoff change in the Yellow River, a typical large river in the arid to semi-arid region, has been studied extensively. However, the spatial and temporal pattern of the runoff variations along the river is still not clear and the contributions of climate change (precipitation and evapotranspiration) and human activities to the runoff changes are not quantified. The purpose of this study is to identify the turning years of the changes in runoff increment for seven sections (above Tangnaihai, Tangnaihai-Lanzhou, Lanzhou-Toudaoguai, Toudaoguai-Longmen, Longmen-Tongguan, Tongguan-Huayuankou and Huayuankou-Lijin) in the Yellow River based on the annual observed data in 1950-2009. These turning years were used to divide the entire period into the baseline period and the measurement period, and calculate the contributions of climate change and human activities to the runoff increment changes in the measurement period. The methods used in this study include cumulative anomaly, linear regression, and the improved method of slope change ratio of cumulative quantity (SCRCQ). Results indicated that the turning years of the runoff increment change were 1989 for the section above Tangnaihai, 1985 for the sections of Tangnaihai-Lanzhou and Lanzhou-Toudaoguai, 1979 for the section of Toudaoguai-Longmen, 1985 for the sections of Longmen-Tongguan and Tongguan-Huayuankou, and 1971 for the section of Huayuankou-Lijin. The contributions to the runoff increment changes in the measurement period from precipitation were 11.98\%, 10.02\%, 16.60\%, 28.49\%, 19.24\%, 9.45\%, and 0.83\%, from potential evapotranspiration were -1.32\%, -1.61\%, -7.37\%, -7.74\%, -5.82\%, -0.96\%, and -3.17\%, and from human activities were 89.34\%, 91.59\%, 90.77\%, 79.25\%, 86.58\%, 91.59\% and 102.34\%, respectively for these seven sections. For the entire runoff change of the whole Yellow River, the total contributions from precipitation were 11.76\%, from potential evapotranspiration were -3.83\%, and from human activities were 92.07\%. These results suggest that human activities have been a dominant influencing factor in the runoff changes not only for each section, but also for the whole river basin since the 1980s.

Many deep learning (DL)-based studies have been conducted for precipitation bias correction and downscaling. However, it is still challenging for the current approaches to handle complex features of hourly precipitation, resulting in the incapability of reproducing small-scale features, such as extreme events. This study developed a customized DL model by incorporating customized loss functions, multitask learning and physically relevant covariates to bias correct and downscale hourly precipitation data. We designed six scenarios to systematically evaluate the added values of weighted loss functions, multitask learning, and atmospheric covariates compared to the regular DL and statistical approaches. The models were trained and tested using the Modern-era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA2) reanalysis and the Stage IV radar observations over the northern coastal region of the Gulf of Mexico on an hourly time scale. We found that all the scenarios with weighted loss functions performed notably better than the other scenarios with conventional loss functions and a quantile mapping-based approach at hourly, daily, and monthly time scales as well as extremes. Multitask learning showed improved performance on capturing fine features of extreme events and accounting for atmospheric covariates highly improved model performance at hourly and aggregated time scales, while the improvement is not as large as from weighted loss functions. We show that the customized DL model can better downscale and bias correct hourly precipitation datasets and provide improved precipitation estimates at fine spatial and temporal resolutions where regular DL and statistical methods experience challenges.},

The parameters and structure of the LSTM model, which should be completely determined in an explanatory manner based on the observed datasets, have a significant impact on the model performance. Due to the limitations and uncertainty in the observed datasets, the uncertainty in daily streamflow prediction needs to be quantitatively assessed. In this work, LSTM models are used to predict daily streamflow for two stations in the Mississippi River basin in Iowa, USA, and the performance of LSTM models with different parameters and inputs is investigated to demonstrate the process of determining the optimal parameters. The results show that the LSTM model with optimized parameters and an optimized structure performs the best among the four data-driven models, and the model with selected predictors (inputs) performs better than that without selected predictors. Moreover, the bootstrap method is employed to generate different realizations of the observed datasets that are used for developing LSTM models; thus, the prediction streamflow values from different LSTM models are finally used for uncertainty analysis in daily streamflow prediction. LSTM can be a promising tool for daily streamflow prediction. When LSTM is combined with Bootstrap method, reliable uncertainty quantification of streamflow prediction is also provided.},

However, the existing univariate bias correction methods often fail to account for such dependences. While the multivariate bias correction methods have been developed to address this issue, they do not consistently outperform the univariate methods due to various assumptions. In this study, using 20 state-of-the-art coupled general circulation models (GCMs) daily mean, maximum and minimum temperature (Tmean, Tmax and Tmin) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), we comprehensively evaluated the Super Resolution Deep Residual Network (SRDRN) deep learning model for climate downscaling and bias correction. The SRDRN model sequentially stacked 20 GCMs with single or multiple input-output channels, so that the biases can be efficiently removed based on the relative relations among different GCMs against observations, and the intervariable dependences can be retained for multivariate bias correction. It corrected biases in spatial dependences by deeply extracting spatial features and making adjustments for daily simulations according to observations. For univariate SRDRN, it considerably reduced larger biases of Tmean in space, time, as well as extremes compared to the quantile delta mapping (QDM) approach. For multivariate SRDRN, it performed better than the dynamic Optimal Transport Correction (dOTC) method and reduced greater biases of Tmax and Tmin but also reproduced intervariable dependences of the observations, where QDM and dOTC showed unrealistic artifacts (Tmax {$<$} Tmin). Additional studies on the deep learning-based approach may bring climate model bias correction and downscaling to the next level.},

Study focus: The Tarim River basin is the largest arid inland river basin in China and recently only Aksu, Yarkant and Hotan Rivers have natural hydraulic connections with it. With climate changing, the runoff from the headwaters of Tarim River basin has undergone obvious changes that significantly affected downstream areas. It is necessary to quantitatively attribute the impact of climate changes on runoff. However, the previous researches mostly focused on the Aksu River basin, and the attribution of runoff changes in the Yarkant and Hotan River basins was nearly blank. This paper is dedicated to reveal the dominated climate factors for the runoff changes in all the three tributaries with large glacier coverage, by combining the glacier-enhanced SWAT model with the original and detrended precipitation and temperature inputs. New hydrological insights for the region: It was recognized that the rising temperature respectively contributed 94 \% and 66 \% to streamflow increases in the Hotan and Aksu River basins with slower glacier shrinking during 1965 2007. Meanwhile, the increased precipitation contributed 87 \% to streamflow increase in the Yarkant River basin with a larger glacier area retreating ratio. It is not as widely believed that the runoff changes in high glacierized basins are more correlated with temperature changes. The respective variation amplitude of temperature and precipitation should be concerned in every catchment.Y},

We compared the effects of these variations on vegetation growth among different frozen ground types and vegetation types in the source region of the Yellow River (SRYR). The results showed that approximately half of the PF area (20.37\% of the SRYR) was projected to degrade into seasonally frozen ground (SFG) during the past four decades; furthermore, the areal average ALT increased by 3.47 cm/yr, and the areal average SFD decreased by 0.93 cm/yr from 1980 to 2018. Accordingly, the growing season Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) presented an increasing trend of 0.002/10yr, and the increase rate and proportion of areas with NDVI increase were largest in the transition zone where PF degraded to SFG (the PF to SFG zone). A correlation analysis indicated that variations in ALT and SFD in the SRYR were significantly correlated with increases of NDVI in the growing season. However, a rapid decrease in SFD ({$<$} -1.4 cm/10yr) could have reduced the soil moisture and, thus, decreased the NDVI. The NDVI for most vegetation types exhibited a significant positive correlation with ALT and a negative correlation with SFD. However, the steppe NDVI exhibited a significant negative correlation with the SFD in the PF to SFG zone but a positive correlation in the SFG zone, which was mainly limited by water condition because of different change rates of the SFD.},

The integrated model is a distributed model that not only accounts for spatial variations in basin terrain, rainfall and soil moisture, but also considers spatial and temporal variation of vegetation cover and evapotranspiration (ET), in particular, thus providing a powerful tool for investigating the hydrological impact of LUCC. The model was constructed using spatial data on topography, soil types and vegetation characteristics together with time series of precipitation from 170 stations in the basin. The model was calibrated and validated based on river discharge data from three stations in the basin for 21 years. The calibration and validation results suggested that the model is suitable for application in the basin. The results show that ET has a positive relationship with LAI (leaf area index), while runoff has a negative relationship with LAI in the same climatic zone that can be described by the surface energy balance and water balance equation. It was found that deforestation would cause an increase in annual runoff and a decrease in annual ET in southern China. Monthly runoff for different land-cover types was found to be inversely related to ET. Also, for most of the scenarios, and particularly for grassland and cropland, the most significant changes occurred in the rainy season, indicating that deforestation would cause a significant increase in monthly runoff in that season in the East River basin. These results are important for water resources management and environmental change monitoring.},

  abstract = {This paper assesses the performances of runoff (Ro) and runoff coefficient (alpha, the ratio of runoff to precipitation) simulations from 23 models during the historical period and then projects their future changes under the two emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5) in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Compared with the UNH/GRDC Ro dataset (0.82 mm day(-1)), the multi-model median (MME) Ro of 1995-2014 produces a comparable global mean magnitude (0.80 mm day(-1)), displays a similar spatial distribution of mean Ro, and also well captures the seasonal cycles at both global and basin scales. The global mean Ro of MME is projected to be increased by 0.01-0.02 mm day(-1) (SSP1-2.6) and 0.02-0.10 mm day(-1) (SSP5-8.5) during the twenty-first century. Regional hotspots for strong increasing Ro appear across most areas of northern high latitudes, Africa, and southeastern Asia, with high inter-model consistency. The global mean alpha is projected to be slightly decreased (-0.17 to -0.63\%) except for the long-term under the SSP5-8.5 (0.26\%). Although signs of changes in Ro vary with the river basins, periods, and scenarios, alpha in more than half (7 out of 12) river basins are projected to decrease. The uneven distributions of projected Ro changes over global land areas are related to the response of multiple hydroclimatic variables to the global warming. Given regions with inconstancy change signs of the projected precipitation, we speculate that changes in Ro are affected by more complicated hydroclimatic processes that warrant further investigations with physical-based approaches. Plain Language Summary Evidence has indicated that the terrestrial hydrology would be changed unevenly over global land areas under a warmer climate. Runoff (Ro) is one of the key components of the land water budget and it represents the natural freshwater resource on the earth. This study assesses the historical simulation performances and then projects future changes in Ro and alpha (the ratio of runoff to precipitation) under two emission scenarios (i.e., SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5) based on the simulations from 23 CMIP6 models. The results show that the multi-model median Ro during the historical period is highly consistent with the reference dataset and captures the seasonal variation in most river basins. During the twenty-first century, the multi-model median of global mean Ro is overall projected to increase in the future and the alpha would slightly decrease except for the long-term under the SSP5-8.5. While signs and magnitudes of projection changes depend on regions and basins, those changes are more evident under higher warming levels. The uneven distributions of projected changes of Ro over global land areas are related to the response of other land surface hydrological variables to the global warming induced by anthropogenic emissions in climate models.},

  abstract = {Dams and reservoirs are among the most widespread human-made infrastructures on Earth. Despite their societal and environmental significance, spatial inventories of dams and reservoirs, even for the large ones, are insufficient. A dilemma of the existing georeferenced dam datasets is the polarized focus on either dam quantity and spatial coverage (e.g., GlObal geOreferenced Database of Dams, GOODD) or detailed attributes for a limited dam quantity or region (e.g., GRanD (Global Reservoir and Dam database) and national inventories). One of the most comprehensive datasets, the World Register of Dams (WRD), maintained by the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD), documents nearly 60 000 dams with an extensive suite of attributes. Unfortunately, the WRD records provide no geographic coordinates, limiting the benefits of their attributes for spatially explicit applications. To bridge the gap between attribute accessibility and spatial explicitness, we introduce the Georeferenced global Dams And Reservoirs (GeoDAR) dataset, created by utilizing the Google Maps geocoding application programming interface (API) and multi-source inventories. We release GeoDAR in two successive versions (v1.0 and v1.1) at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6163413 (Wang et al., 2022). GeoDAR v1.0 holds 22 560 dam points georeferenced from the WRD, whereas v1.1 consists of (a) 24 783 dam points after a harmonization between GeoDAR v1.0 and GRanD v1.3 and (b) 21 515 reservoir polygons retrieved from high-resolution water masks based on a one-to-one relationship between dams and reservoirs. Due to geocoding challenges, GeoDAR spatially resolved {$\sim$} 40 \% of the records in the WRD, which, however, comprise over 90 \% of the total reservoir area, catchment area, and reservoir storage capacity. GeoDAR does not release the proprietary WRD attributes, but upon individual user requests we may provide assistance in associating GeoDAR spatial features with the WRD attribute information that users have acquired from ICOLD. Despite this limit, GeoDAR, with a dam quantity triple that of GRanD, significantly enhances the spatial details of smaller but more widespread dams and reservoirs and complements other existing global dam inventories. Along with its extended attribute accessibility, GeoDAR is expected to benefit a broad range of applications in hydrologic modeling, water resource management, ecosystem health, and energy planning.},

  abstract = {Drought is a severe and chronic natural hazard that deeply affects production and livelihoods. Its characteristics and propagation have been extensively discussed, but the effects of temperature, evapotranspiration, and runoff on drought under different carbon emission conditions are still worth considering. Combining with the release of the Sixth International Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), datasets of multiple patterns were compared with observational datasets. The most available data were screened to verify the accuracy of CMIP6 and were used to determine global Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and Standardized Runoff Index (SRI) to analyze global drought properties, such as frequency, duration, and spatial extent. According to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios, drought properties in the future were compared with those in the past and results were as follows: First, more accurate precipitation and evapotranspiration data were provided by the CanEMS5, and more accurate soil moisture data were provided by the BCC-CSM2-MR. Second, in the 21st century, the frequency, duration and spatial extent of global drought in most areas would increase. Finally, the key influencing factor of drought would the evapotranspiration. The relationship among rainfall, runoff, and temperature was mutually binding. Overall, global droughts, in particular exceptional droughts, showed a progressive worsening of conditions and a marked increase in the future. This study provides a reference for exploring global drought changes under climate change and provides a basis for the application of the CMIP6.},

  abstract = {The geographical extent, magnitude, and uncertainty of global climate change have been widely discussed and have critical policy implications at both global and local scales. In this study, a new analysis of annual mean global land surface air temperature since 1880 was generated, which has greater coverage and lower uncertainty than previous distributions. The Biased Sentinel Hospitals Areal Disease Estimation (BSHADE) method, used in this study, makes a best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE) when a sample is small and biased to a spatially heterogeneous population. For the period of 1901--2010, the warming trend was found to be 0.109 {$\circ$}C decade-1 with 95\% confidence intervals between 0.081 {$\circ$}C and 0.137 {$\circ$}C. Additionally, warming exhibited different spatial patterns in different periods. In the early 20th century (1923--1950), warming occurred mainly in the mid-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, whereas in the most recent decades (1977--2014), warming was more spatially extensive across the global land surface. Compared with other common methods, the difference in results appears in the areas with few stations and in the early years, when stations had sparse coverage and were unevenly distributed. Validation, which was performed using real data that simulated the historic situation, showed a smaller error in the BSHADE estimate than in other methods. This study produced a new database with greater coverage and less uncertainty that will improve the understanding of climate dynamics on the Earth since 1880, especially in isolated areas and early periods, and will benefit the assessment of climate-change-related issues, such as the effects of human activities.},

  abstract = {Understanding the pattern of changes in extreme heat is crucial to developing climate change adaptation strategies. Existing studies mostly focus on changes in air temperature and tend to overlook soil temperature; however, changes in extreme heat in air and soil can be inconsistent under global change and water--carbon cycling may be more sensitive to soil condition. In this study, we examine the global pattern of long-term trends in the difference between air temperature and soil temperature (Tsoil - T2m) for the hottest month of the year during the period of 1961--2022. The results show that in certain hotspots, such as the middle and high latitudes of Eurasia, the Mediterranean, and the Western United States, the increasing trend in soil temperature has exceeded the increasing trend in 2 m air temperature during the warm season, implying that the land surface can contribute to the increase in air temperature extreme by releasing more heat than before. Our study suggest that the effect of soil temperature to air temperature is strongly related to the partitioning of surface latent heat, sensible heat (H) and soil heat flux (G). In the hot spots, Tsoil - T2m was significantly positively correlated with H and G while a significant negative correlation was found with evaporative fraction (EF) (p{$<$} 0.05), and the significant correlations with G and EF exhibit greater spatial heterogeneity. Moreover, the higher the degree of vegetation cover and soil moisture the smaller the difference between soil and air high temperatures. Therefore, changes in vegetation cover and land use management may play an important role in regulating the range of soil and air temperature differences as well as land-atmosphere coupling effects on heat extreme.},

  abstract = {The solid precipitation in the cold season over the TP is important for the recharge of snow cover, glaciers, rivers, etc. During the past decades, the TP has experienced enhanced warming in the cold season, which could transfer more snowfall to rainfall and influence the land-atmosphere hydrological cycle of the Asian water tower. However, most CMIP6 models underestimate the cold season temperature and overestimate the total precipi-tation, and the performance of the precipitation phase in the CMIP6 simulations remains unclear. This study investigates the precipitation phase bias in the cold season by comparing simulations from CMIP6 to observa-tions. The results suggest that the snowfall-to-precipitation ratio (SPR) from CMIP6 was significantly under-estimated, and the SPR at the southern edge of the TP was underestimated by approximately 30\%. However, the decreasing trend of SPR is significantly overestimated. Comparing the influence of the surface temperature and total precipitation, the correlation coefficient between the mean SPR bias and the simulated temperature bias is-0.701 with a 99\% confidence level, which is much greater than that with total precipitation bias. The mean SPR in the seven best models is much greater than the ensemble mean of the original 23 CMIP6 models over the TP. Moreover, the SPR varies significantly under different future scenarios. Under the most severe scenario, the decrease in SPR exceeds-21.45\%, substantially influencing the water balance over the TP, while the decline is only-9.79\% under the weak scenario. Therefore, the warming caused by high emissions should not be ignored when projecting the precipitation phase, and the significant effect of surface temperature on the precipitation phase requires additional consideration when investigating the hydrological cycle imbalance over the TP.},

  abstract = {Frozen ground degradation resulting from climate warming on the Tibetan Plateau has aroused wide concern in recent years. In this study, the maximum thickness of seasonally frozen ground (MTSFG) is estimated by the Stefan equation, which is validated using long-term frozen depth observations. The permafrost distribution is estimated by the temperature at the top of permafrost (TTOP) model, which is validated using borehole observations. The two models are applied to the upper Yellow River Basin (UYRB) for analyzing the spatio-temporal changes in frozen ground. The simulated results show that the areal mean MTSFG in the UYRB decreased by 3.47 cm/10 a during 1965-2014, and that approximately 23\% of the permafrost in the UYRB degraded to seasonally frozen ground during the past 50 years. Using the climate data simulated by 5 General Circulation Models (GCMs) under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5, the areal mean MTSFG is projected to decrease by 1.69 to 3.07 cm/10 a during 2015-2050, and approximately 40\% of the permafrost in 1991-2010 is projected to degrade into seasonally frozen ground in 2031-2050. This study provides a framework to estimate the long-term changes in frozen ground based on a combination of multi-source observations at the basin scale, and this framework can be applied to other areas of the Tibetan Plateau. The estimates of frozen ground changes could provide a scientific basis for water resource management and ecological protection under the projected future climate changes in headwater regions on the Tibetan Plateau.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have evaluated the reliability and hydrologic utility of various rainfall data sets through hydrological modeling. However, the calibration of hydrological models compensates for errors in rainfall inputs. The drivers, conditions, and factors affecting the calibration of hydrological models given the accuracy of rainfall inputs are not well understood. Here, we explore hydrological model adaptability to rainfall inputs of varied quality and its potential mechanisms. Twenty-eight rainfall products from multiple sources are collected for a headwater catchment in the Southern United States. These rainfall data sets include measurements from rain gauges, weather radars, satellites, reanalysis products, and Weather Research and Forecasting model simulations. Such rainfall data sets with varied errors are used to independently calibrate a widely used conceptual Xin'anjiang (XAJ) hydrological model. Results suggest that the hydrological model can often adapt well to two scenarios of inaccurate rainfall inputs producing high-performance streamflow simulations. This adaptive ability is controlled by an adaptable threshold of the overall bias of the rainfall inputs. Moreover, hydrological model adaptability to rainfall inputs is further influenced by how event-based rainfall bias shapes the overall rainfall bias, especially from those of heavy rainstorms. The hydrological model can adapt to those rainfall inputs that contain important information content for model calibration. Notably, the adaptability to rainfall inputs of the XAJ model is mainly controlled by a bias reduction through adjustment of evapotranspiration and soil moisture storage, yielding satisfactory effective rainfall. The study quantitatively sheds new light on hydrological model adaptability to rainfall input quality.},

  abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau (TP) contains the largest permafrost region in the mid-low latitudes and the largest area of glaciers outside of the polar regions. In recent decades, this region has experienced vegetation greening (e.g., increasing leaf area index) due to climate change. As the largest exorheic river on the TP, the Upper Brahmaputra Basin (UBB) is very sensitive to climate change, experiencing the humidifying and significant warming. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal variability of frozen ground and vegetation over the last four decades in the UBB and explored how these changes have impacted river runoff using a water- and energy-budget distributed hydrological model (WEB-DHM). We found that almost 50\% of permafrost transformed into seasonally frozen or unfrozen ground from 1981 to 2019 with the great improvement of vegetation leaf area index (LAI). Based on the variable-controlling approach (set the air temperature or vegetation unchanged), we revealed that frozen ground degradation caused an average of 9.3 billion m(3) of water loss per year, accounting for 5.4\% of total UBB river runoff, even if frozen ground degradation can increase water resources at the early stage. However, vegetation greening has caused a runoff decline by 10.9 billion m(3) (6.4\%) annually due to enhanced evapotranspiration. These findings highlight that it is critical to understand and mitigate the impacts of changing frozen ground and vegetation, when managing water resources availability and ecosystem conservation under rapid climate change.},

  abstract = {The quality of precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) data greatly affects the hydrological modeling performance. Considerable attention has been paid to identifying the influence of biased P or PET inputs independently. However, few studies have explored the joint interaction of biases in P and PET inputs on hydrological simulations. Here, we investigate the mutual compensation of P and PET biases on the performance of two widely used conceptual hydrological models, the Xinanjiang model and the Probability Distributed Model. P and PET from HYREX (HYdrological Radar EXperiment) and CAMELS-GB (Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies in Great Britain) data sets are collected over five catchments with varying characteristics in Great Britain. Different biases are added to these original time series to generate 6560 biased input scenarios. The results suggest that there is a certain compensational relationship between the biases in P and PET inputs to reproduce desirable streamflow simulations. A new hydrological proxy named Compensational Interaction Angle (CIA) is identified and found to be stationary with various modeling periods, as well as stable with different hydrological models despite model equifinality. Further, the CIA highly relates to the long-term climate aridity ratio. The catchments with greater aridity have larger CIAs. This study offers a fresh perspective to analyze the input errors in hydrological modeling. The results can help to better understand P and PET interactions in hydrological modeling, and guide the selection/evaluation/bias-correction of P and PET data sets for hydrological applications.},

The model uses consumption curves to partition water to a number of components according to supply and demand and to represent spatial and temporal heterogeneity of catchment processes in a parsimonious formulation. The Wapaba model was benchmarked against the well known abcd monthly water balance model as well as the original monthly Budyko framework model and found to outperform both on the Australian catchments. The Wapaba model was also compared with two daily water balance models widely used in Australia. It had validation performance comparable to or better than the daily water balance models in simulating monthly runoff on the Australian catchments. This indicates that the monthly model has not been disadvantaged for not using the within-month temporal sequences of the forcing variables. The finding supports the use of monthly water balance models for applications where one is primarily interested in monthly, seasonal and annual streamflow volumes or where daily input data are not readily available.

However, constrained by difficult access and sparse in situ observations, the variations in precipitation, glaciers, frozen ground, and vegetation across the UB basin remain largely unknown, and consequently the impacts of climate change on streamflow cannot be accurately assessed. To fill this gap, this project aims to establish a basinwide, large-scale observational network (that includes hydrometeorology, glacier, frozen ground, and vegetation observations), which helps quantify the UB runoff processes under climate--cryosphere--vegetation changes. At present, a multisphere observational network has been established throughout the catchment: 1) 12 stations with custom-built weighing automatic rain/snow meters and temperature probes to obtain elevation-dependent gradients; 2) 9 stations with soil moisture/temperature observations at four layers (10, 40, 80, 120 cm) covering Alpine meadow, grasslands, shrub, and forest to measure vegetation (biomass and vegetation types) and soil (physical properties) simultaneously; 3) 34 sets of probes to monitor frozen ground temperatures from 4,500 to 5,200 m elevation (100-m intervals), and two observation systems to monitor water and heat transfer processes in frozen ground at Xuegela (5,278 m) and Mayoumula (5,256 m) Mountains, for improved mapping of permafrost and active layer characteristics; 4) 5 sets of altimetry discharge observations along ungauged cross sections to supplement existing operational gauges; 5) high-precision glacier boundary and ice-surface elevation observations at Namunani Mountain with differential GPS, to supplement existing glacier observations for validating satellite imagery. This network provides an excellent opportunity to monitor UB catchment processes in great detail.},

However, the development of these models has long been hindered by their low accuracy. In order to improve the streamflow simulation accuracy of GHMs, we developed a GHM-the FLEX-Global-based on the regionalization of hydrological model parameters. The FLEX-Global model is primarily based on the framework of the FLEX hydrological model coupled with the HAND-based Storage Capacity curve (HSC) runoff generation module to calculate net rainfall, and uses the global river-routing CaMa-Flood model to calculate river network routing. This new model allows for streamflow simulation at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees and a temporal resolution of 1 day in global catchments. To validate FLEX-Global accuracy, the FLEX-Global-simulated streamflow of 26 major rivers distributed in five different climate zones was compared with the observed data from the Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC). Next, the model performance of FLEX-Global was further verified by comparing it with that of seven existing GHMs with varying accuracy in the five climate zones. Multi-metric evaluation indicated that the streamflow simulation accuracy was improved by the FLEX-Global model with regionalized parameters, especially in the tropical and dry climate zones. This newly-developed GHM with regionalized parameters can provide scientific support for the assessment of climate change impact, optimization of global water resource mangement, simulation of Earth's multi-sphere coupling, and implementation of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Inter-comparison Project (ISIMIP).},

  abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau (TP), also known as the world's Third Pole, is underlain by frozen ground and is highly sensitive to climate change. However, it remains unclear how the variations in soil freeze-thaw could affect vegetation dynamics across the TP. In this study, we adopted the latest datasets for vegetation, climate and soil freeze-thaw in the past two decades to explore the possible impacts of changes in soil freeze-thaw on vegetation greenness and phenology on the TP. According to the satellite-based observations, the TP showed an overall greening trend during 2001-2020, and the growing season length increased significantly at a rate of 3.6 days/ 10a, mainly contributed by the advances of the start of the growing season (2.7 days/10a). Based on ridge regression and partial correlation analysis, air temperature and precipitation were found to be the major dominant factors of vegetation dynamics on the TP, and precipitation played a dominant role in the relatively warm-dry southwestern TP where vegetation browning and spring phenology delays were observed. In the relatively cold regions, earlier soil thaw onset generally facilitated spring phenology, and longer soil thaw duration tended to increase the growing season soil moisture content, which could in turn enhance vegetation greenness. In the relatively warm regions, however, earlier thaw onset and longer thaw duration could possibly exacerbate the growing season water stress and limit vegetation growth. The negative impacts were more evident in the regions with unstable and completely degraded permafrost according to the results in the source region of Yellow and Yangtze rivers. Our findings highlight the spatially varying role of soil freeze-thaw changes in vegetation dynamics, which have important implications for the carbon budget of the TP in a warming future climate as frozen ground continues to degrade.},

Projection of glacier (especially small glaciers) runoff change is imperative for adapting to climate change and mitigating relevant risks. We aim to provide an up-to-date knowledge of the glacier area and runoff change for 2016-2099 in the Sanjiangyuan.New hydrological insights for the region: Projections based on CMIP6 archive show that 1) glacier area in the Sanjiangyuan for the four SSPs will shrink by 36 +/- 12 \% (SSP1-2.6), 42 +/- 20 \% (SSP2-4.5), 49 +/- 19 \% (SSP3-7.0) and 61 +/- 15 \% (SSP5-8.5) by the end of the 21st century. Small glacier dominated Lancang River basin is more sensitive to climate change than large glacier abundant Yangtze River basin and Yellow River basin. The Lancang River basin is pro-jected to experience the greatest relative glacier area shrinkage, 10 \% of glacier area and 55 \% of glacier number will disappear for SSP5-8.5; 2) annual glacier runoff in the Yangtze River and Yellow River will reach peak water around 2080 under SSP3-7.0, while the Lancang River is already in or near peak water timing for all SSPs. Higher emission scenario tends to yield later peak water timing due to the changes in snow melt.},

  abstract = {Runoff from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, a major global water tower, is crucial to regional hydrological processes and the availability of water for a large population living downstream. Climate change, especially changes in precipitation and temperature, directly impacts hydrological processes and exacerbates shifts in the cryosphere, such as glacier and snow melt, leading to changes in runoff. Although there is a consensus on increased runoff due to climate change, it is still unclear to what extent precipitation and temperature contribute to runoff variations. This lack of understanding is one of the primary sources of uncertainty when assessing the hydrological impacts of climate change. In this study, a large-scale, high-resolution, and well-calibrated distributed hydrological model was employed to quantify the longterm runoff of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and the changes in runoff and runoff coefficient were analyzed. Furthermore, the impacts of precipitation and temperature on runoff variation were quantitatively estimated. The results found that runoff and runoff coefficient decreased from southeast to northwest, with mean values of 184.77 mm and 0.37, respectively. Notably, the runoff coefficient exhibited a significant increasing trend of 1.27 \%/10 yr (P {$<$} 0.001), while the southeastern and northern regions of the plateau showed a declining tendency. We further showed that the warming and humidification of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau led to an increase in the runoff by 9.13 mm/10 yr (P {$<$} 0.001). And precipitation is a more important contributor than temperature across the plateau, contributing 72.08 \% and 27.92 \% to the runoff increase, respectively. At the basin scale, the influence of precipitation and temperature on runoff varies among basins, with the Daduhe basin and the Inner basin being the most and least influenced by precipitation, respectively. This research analyses historical runoff changes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and provides insights into the contributions of climate change to runoff.},

  abstract = {Runoff and sediment loads have exhibited significant changes over the past six decades in the Yellow River Basin, China. The current study evaluates the changing trends and regime shifts in runoff and sediment loads at both the annual and monthly time scales. The associated spatial and temporal variations are analyzed by a sequential t-test analysis of the regime shifts (STARS) approach and the "breaks for additive seasonal and trend" (BFAST) model using hydrological data at eight stations from the 1950s to 2011. Both runoff and sediment loads exhibit significant declines (p {$<$} 0.05), except in the upper reaches of the river near the Tangnaihai station. The regime shifts detected by the STARS approach are not completely consistent with the results from the BFAST method. In most cases, the regime shifts occurred in 1969 and 1986, due to the construction of large reservoirs. Climate change and other human activities, such as large-scale soil and water conservation measures, can result in abrupt changes in hydrological series at some stations. The trapping effects of reservoirs not only cause regime shifts of runoff and sediment loads, but also adjust their inter-annual and seasonal distributions. Various soil and water conservation measures are responsible for the significant reduction in runoff and sediment loads in the mid-lower reaches of the Yellow River Basin. In addition, water withdrawals from both river runoff and ground water play a critical role in the changing trends in runoff and indirectly alter the sediment loads. The findings provide a good reference for the effective promotion of climate change adaptation, water resources planning and river basin management.},

Sensitivities of runoff to climate change were investigated by adopting hypothetical climate scenarios. Results indicate that the water balance model performs well for monthly discharge simulations of climatically different catchments with Nash--Sutcliffe coefficients [65 \% and relative errors falling in the range of {\textpm}5 \%. In general, runoff in arid north China are more sensitive to climate change than those in humid south China. A 1 {$^\circ$}C rise in temperature would probably lead to 1.2--4.4 \% decreases in runoff. A decrease in precipitation of 10 \% would result in 9.4--17.4 \% of decreases in runoff.

We find that during 1998--2019, the rising downstream runoff (lower Nuxia; +6.40 {\texttimes} 108 m3/yr) offsets the dropping upstream runoff (upper Nuxia; -6.89 {\texttimes} 108 m3/yr); however, only the marginal contribution from the vanishing eastern-Himalaya and Nyainq{\^e}ntanglha glaciers. During 1998--2019, dry upstream illustrates limited glacier melt (15.7 mm/yr) with dominated snow melt (78.8 mm/yr); while much larger at humid downstream (144.8 mm/yr for glacier melt and 219.1 mm/yr for snow melt). From 1981 to 2019, we observe glacier-to-snow melt transition in both upstream and downstream due to glacier degradation and growing nonmonsoon-season precipitation.},

  abstract = {Data from General Circulation Models (GCMs) are often used to investigate hydrological impacts of climate change. However GCM data are known to have large biases, especially for precipitation. In this study the usefulness of GCM data for hydrological studies, with focus on discharge variability and extremes, was tested by using bias-corrected daily climate data of the 20CM3 control experiment from a selection of twelve GCMs as input to the global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB. Results of these runs were compared with discharge observations of the GRDC and discharges calculated from model runs based on two meteorological datasets constructed from the observation-based CRU TS2.1 and ERA-40 reanalysis. In the first dataset the CRU TS 2.1 monthly timeseries were downscaled to daily timeseries using the ERA-40 dataset (ERA6190). This dataset served as a best guess of the past climate and was used to analyze the performance of PCR-GLOBWB. The second dataset was created from the ERA-40 timeseries bias-corrected with the CRU TS 2.1 dataset using the same bias-correction method as applied to the GCM datasets (ERACLM). Through this dataset the influence of the bias-correction method was quantified. The bias-correction was limited to monthly mean values of precipitation, potential evaporation and temperature, as our focus was on the reproduction of inter- and intra-annual variability. After bias-correction the spread in discharge results of the GCM based runs decreased and results were similar to results of the ERA-40 based runs, especially for rivers with a strong seasonal pattern. Overall the bias-correction method resulted in a slight reduction of global runoff and the method performed less well in arid and mountainous regions. However, deviations between GCM results and GRDC statistics did decrease for {$<$} span style='border-top: 1px solid \#000; color: \#000;'{$>$} Q , Q90 and IAV. After bias-correction consistency amongst models was high for mean discharge and timing (Qpeak), but relatively low for inter-annual variability (IAV). This suggests that GCMs can be of use in global hydrological impact studies in which persistence is of less relevance (e.g. in case of flood rather than drought studies). Furthermore, the bias-correction influences mean discharges more than extremes, which has the positive consequence that changes in daily rainfall distribution and subsequent changes in discharge extremes will also be preserved when the bias-correction method is applied to future GCM datasets. However, it also shows that agreement between GCMs remains relatively small for discharge extremes. Because of the large deviations between observed and simulated discharge, in which both errors in climate forcing, model structure and to a lesser extent observations are accumulated, it is advisable not to work with absolute discharge values for the derivation of future discharge projections, but rather calculate relative changes by dividing the absolute change by the absolute discharge calculated for the control experiment.},

The radiogenic isotope data are used in combination with a multitude of proxy indicators for the climatic and oceanographic development of the eastern Fram Strait during the past 8500 years. To calibrate the downcore data, seawater and core top samples from the area were analysed for their radiogenic isotope compositions. Core top leachates reveal relatively high (more radiogenic) Nd isotope compositions between {$\varepsilon$}Nd {\`A}9.7 and {\`A}9.1, which are higher than present-day seawater {$\varepsilon$}Nd in eastern Fram Strait ({\`A}12.6 to {\`A}10.5) and indicate that the seawater values have only been established very recently. The core top data agree well with the downcore signatures within the uppermost 40 cm of the sediment core ({$\varepsilon$}Nd {\`A}9.1 to {\`A}8.8) indicating a reduced inflow of waters from the Nordic Seas, concurrent with cool conditions and a south-eastward shift of the marginal ice zone after ca 2.8 cal ka BP (Late Holocene). High sea-ice abundances in eastern Fram Strait are coeval with the well-known Neoglacial trend in the northern North Atlantic region. In contrast, warmer conditions of the late Early to Mid-Holocene were accompanied by lower (less radiogenic) {$\varepsilon$}Nd signatures of the bottom waters indicating an increased admixture from the Nordic Seas ({\`A}10.6 to {\`A}10.1).},

  abstract = {This paper presents a strategy for diagnosing and interpreting hydrological nonstationarity, aiming to improve hydrological models and their predictive ability under changing hydroclimatic conditions. The strategy consists of four elements: (i) detecting potential systematic errors in the calibration data; (ii) hypothesizing a set of ``nonstationary'' parameterizations of existing hydrological model structures, where one or more parameters vary in time as functions of selected covariates; (iii) trialing alternative stationary model structures to assess whether parameter nonstationarity can be reduced by modifying the model structure; and (iv) selecting one or more models for prediction. The Scott Creek catchment in South Australia and the lumped hydrological model GR4J are used to illustrate the strategy. Streamflow predictions improve significantly when the GR4J parameter describing the maximum capacity of the production store is allowed to vary in time as a combined function of: (i) an annual sinusoid; (ii) the previous 365 day rainfall and potential evapotranspiration; and (iii) a linear trend. This improvement provides strong evidence of model nonstationarity. Based on a range of hydrologically oriented diagnostics such as flow-duration curves, the GR4J model structure was modified by introducing an additional calibration parameter that controls recession behavior and by making actual evapotranspiration dependent only on catchment storage. Model comparison using an information-theoretic measure (the Akaike Information Criterion) and several hydrologically oriented diagnostics shows that the GR4J modifications clearly improve predictive performance in Scott Creek catchment. Based on a comparison of 22 versions of GR4J with different representations of nonstationarity and other modifications, the model selection approach applied in the exploratory period (used for parameter estimation) correctly identifies models that perform well in a much drier independent confirmatory period.},

  abstract = {Limitations in water quantity and quality are among the greatest social and economic problems facing mankind. However, difficulties in estimating the global Longterm average runoff have led to differences of as much as 30\% when integrated to the whole earth. Model estimates of runoff are especially uncertain for the 50\% of the global land surface lacking consistent runoff data. In this study, we present the WASMOD-M global water-balance model, constructed to provide robust runoff estimates both for gauged and ungauged basins. WASMOD-M is a conceptual water-budgeting model with two state-variables and five tunable parameters. A simple parameter-value estimation procedure allowed "acceptable" parameter values to be identified both for the majority of gauged basins, and for most ungauged basins. Acceptable global simulations could be accomplished with continentally constant parameter values but at the cost of compensating errors on a basin scale. A "standard", spatially-distributed parameter-value set was derived for a "best" global simulation. Of the simulated 59132 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees cells, 45\% got "good" parameter values as a by-product of regionalisation, 41\% from regionalisation, whereas 14\% were given a default value set. This global set allowed simulation of the 1915-2000 world water balance. The simulation was in the same range as previously published model results and compilations of runoff measurements. Long-term average within-year runoff variations agreed we[[ with previously published results for most of the studied runoff stations although WASMOD-M was only calibrated against tong-term average runoff. Improvement of WASMOD-M and other global water-balance models should be simplified by a common definition of basin boundaries and areas, as well as runoff. Further, modelling progress will depend on improved global datasets of precipitation and runoff regulation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Six approaches for downscaling climate model outputs for use in hydrologic simulation were evaluated, with particular emphasis on each method's ability to produce precipitation and other variables used to drive a macroscale hydrology model applied at much higher spatial resolution than the climate model. Comparisons were made on the basis of a twenty-year retrospective ( 1975 1995) climate simulation produced by the NCAR-DOE Parallel Climate Model (PCM), and the implications of the comparison for a future ( 2040 - 2060) PCM climate scenario were also explored. The six approaches were made up of three relatively simple statistical downscaling methods - linear interpolation (LI), spatial disaggregation (SD), and bias-correction and spatial disaggregation (BCSD) - each applied to both PCM output directly ( at T42 spatial resolution), and after dynamical downscaling via a Regional ClimateModel (RCM - at 1/2-degree spatial resolution), for downscaling the climate model outputs to the 1/8-degree spatial resolution of the hydrological model. For the retrospective climate simulation, results were compared to an observed gridded climatology of temperature and precipitation, and gridded hydrologic variables resulting from forcing the hydrologic model with observations. The most significant findings are that the BCSD method was successful in reproducing the main features of the observed hydrometeorology from the retrospective climate simulation, when applied to both PCM and RCMoutputs. Linear interpolation produced better results using RCM output than PCM output, but both methods (PCM-LI and RCM-LI) lead to unacceptably biased hydrologic simulations. Spatial disaggregation of the PCM output produced results similar to those achieved with the RCM interpolated output; nonetheless, neither PCM nor RCM output was useful for hydrologic simulation purposes without a bias-correction step. For the future climate scenario, only the BCSD-method ( using PCM or RCM) was able to produce hydrologically plausible results. With the BCSD method, the RCM-derived hydrology was more sensitive to climate change than the PCM-derived hydrology.},

Vegetation greening, largely due to the result of the 'Grain for Green' program implemented in the Loess Plateau, is affecting regional streamflow together with climate change and direct human impacts. There is thus an urgent need to evaluate the relative importance of causes of streamflow variation in this region. A Hydrological Model of L ' ecole de Technologie Superieure (HMETS)-based segment identification analysis framework was presented to quantify the impacts of climate and human-driven changes on runoff under regional vegetation greening. Results showed that climate change and human interference were alternately dominant in the hydrological cycle from 1976 to 2015. Climate change played a major role in affecting runoff variation before 2000, and then human interference dominated. It is worth noting that temperature increases resulted in runoff reduction and induced more changes in streamflow when precipitation was high. Vegetation greening contributed highly to streamflow attenuation, and its impact on runoff variation was more significant after 2007. Generally, understanding the effects of temperature increases and vegetation greening on streamflow is important for the development of appropriate adaptation strategies for the planning and management of regional water resources.},

  abstract = {Variations in surface air temperature and precipitation are closely associated because of their thermodynamic relations. The climate shift in the late 1970s and associated changes in precipitation over East Asia have been well reported. However, how the covariability of surface air temperature and precipitation responds to the climate shift is not yet well understood. We used the observed mean(Tmean), daily maximum(Tmax), and minimum(Tmin) surface air temperatures and precipitation during the period of 1953--2000 to explore this issue. Results show that the covariability between Tmean and precipitation experienced remarkable changes over certain areas of East Asia after the climate shift with evident seasonal dependencies. In winter, after the climate shift significantly negative correlations occupied more areas over Mongolia and China. By contrast, in summer after the climate shift significantly negative correlations which existed over almost entire East Asia during the pre-shift period were mostly weakened with the exception of enhanced correlations over some small isolated areas. Changes in the covariability of Tmax and precipitation showed a similar spatial pattern to that of the Tmean, whereas the Tmin-precipitation covariability did not. In winter, after the climate shift positive correlations between Tmin and precipitation over southern China were largely weakened, while the areas with significantly negative correlations increased over Mongolia. In summer, changes in Tmin-precipitation covariability appeared to be a negative-positive-negative pattern from south to north over East Asia, with positive changes occurring in the Yangtze-Huai River valley and Korea and negative changes occurring over South China and Japan, and northern part of East Asia. ?Keywords: surface air temperature, precipitation, co-},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the changes in heavy precipitation and floods and the causes of flood risk changes in the Beijiang River basin in southern China. Peak flow, daily discharge, and precipitation data from 1969 to 2011 were examined. Trends were calculated using Sen's slope estimator. The statistical significance of the observed trends was checked with the Mann--Kendall method. Change points were detected using the Pettitt test and moving T-test methods. The hydrological periodicity was revealed by wavelet transformation. The results showed that the changes in monthly and monthly maximum 1- and 5-day precipitation and discharges during the flood season showed very similar characteristics. They experienced positive (negative) trends mainly in June--July (April, May, and August), and mostly did not experience significant change points. Compared with the period 1969--1990, monthly and monthly maximum 1(5)-day precipitation and discharges showed increasing (decreasing) trends, mainly in June--July (April--May) in 1991--2011. Overall, the changes in flood risk were mainly influenced by precipitation variability. However, human activity (including urbanization and the construction of reservoirs, soil and water conservation measures, and land use change, among others) have probably affected the flooding process in the study area. The decreases in peak flows during the late 1980s and early 1990s were probably caused by large-scale soil and water conservation measures. Construction of reservoirs in the past 20 years also played a role in the reduction of peak flows. The results of this study are of great scientific value to better understand the changing flood risk under the changing environment in the Beijiang River basin.},

  abstract = {Decomposing the uncertainty of global climate models is highly instructive in understanding climate change. However, it remains unclear whether sources of uncertainty have changed as the models have evolved and the extents to which uncertainty in temperature and precipitation are narrowed after bias correction (BC). We quantified uncertainty in temperature and precipitation projections over global land from three sources---model uncertainty, scenario uncertainty, and internal variability---and compared results from the models participating in the 5th and 6th phases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6). In addition, we investigated the potential of four BC methods for narrowing uncertainty in temperature and precipitation over the globe and individual continents. Raw projections of temperature and precipitation have greater uncertainty and lower fractional uncertainty relative to their anomalies. The largest temperature uncertainties appear in high-latitude and high-altitude regions, and the largest precipitation uncertainties are in low-latitude regions and mountainous and coastal areas. For uncertainties in CMIP6 temperatures, the contribution from model uncertainty decreases with time (from 99\% to 39\%), while the contribution from scenario uncertainty increases with time (from 0.01\% to 61\%). For precipitation projections, the contribution from model uncertainty predominates (98\%), while the contributions from scenario uncertainty (1.8\%) and internal variability (0.2\%) are extremely low. Four BC methods have exhibited excellent ability to reduce uncertainty, and among them, BC and spatial disaggregation has the best performance. These findings can help us better understand the characteristics of the models, while also providing decision makers with more accurate information to address climate mitigation and adaptation measures.},

We evaluated the impact of climate warming on snowmelt rates using the GlobSnow v2.0 and the second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications data sets over the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during the past 38years (1980-2017). Higher ablation rates were found in the locations with deeper snow water equivalent (SWE) because high snow melt rates occurred in late spring and early summer in deep snowpack regions. In addition, due to the reduction of SWE in deep snowpack regions, moderate and high snow ablation rates showed a decreasing trend. Therefore, slower snowmelt rates were found over the entire NH in a warmer climate in general. Based on projections of SWE in Representative Concentration Pathways 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 climate scenarios, slower snowmelt rates in the NH may continue to happen in the future. Plain Language Summary Snowmelt is a major fresh water resource that supplies human lives and ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Recent climate warming has altered the patterns of snow distribution and snowmelt processes. However, such processes are poorly understood. In the current research, we investigated the snowmelt rates over the NH between 1980 and 2017 using the GlobSnow v2.0 and the second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications data sets. In contrast to previous hypotheses, we found that slower snowmelt rate has occurred with climate warming, which can be explained by the decrease of snow water equivalent in deep snowpack regions. Based on the projected snow water equivalent data sets in this century, we also predicted that slower snowmelt rates in the NH may continue to happen in the future. Our analyses also indicated that slower snowmelt would decrease spring runoff and influence vegetation phenology and ecological processes.},

Based on statistical analyses of remote sensing data from 1979 to 2018, this study explored changes of snow characteristics and climate parameters in the basin. This region has, despite rapidly changing ambient conditions, not previously been investigated at the current level of detail, including multiple snow-related variables. New hydrological insights for the region We show that the average snow depth (SD) decreased over the considered 40-year period, while the snow covered days showed an opposite, increasing trend. This pattern was attributed to a combined effect of a gradually earlier arrival of the first snow and a gradually later arrival of the last snow, with overall more frequent occurrence of instantaneous snow cover. Such short-duration snow events are likely linked to regionally increasing precipitation amounts and intensities that on an event basis can outweigh melting effects of increased temperatures. The results furthermore underscored a high degree of spatio-temporal heterogeneity within the basin, not least in SD, which decreases in 27\% and increases in 73\% of the basin. These findings have crucial implications for energy budgets and frozen season length of the basin, raising questions about the prevalence of similar dynamics across the Tibetan plateau.},

  abstract = {Rainfall-runoff modeling is a complex nonlinear time series problem. While there is still room for improvement, researchers have been developing physical and machine learning models for decades to predict runoff using rainfall data sets. With the advancement of computational hardware resources and algorithms, deep learning methods such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) model and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling have shown a good deal of promise in dealing with time series problems by considering long-term dependencies and multiple outputs. This study presents an application of a prediction model based on LSTM and the seq2seq structure to estimate hourly rainfall-runoff. Focusing on two Midwestern watersheds, namely, Clear Creek and Upper Wapsipinicon River in Iowa, these models were used to predict hourly runoff for a 24-hr period using rainfall observation, rainfall forecast, runoff observation, and empirical monthly evapotranspiration data from all stations in these two watersheds. The models were evaluated using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, the correlation coefficient, statistical bias, and the normalized root-mean-square error. The results show that the LSTM-seq2seq model outperforms linear regression, Lasso regression, Ridge regression, support vector regression, Gaussian processes regression, and LSTM in all stations from these two watersheds. The LSTM-seq2seq model shows sufficient predictive power and could be used to improve forecast accuracy in short-term flood forecast applications. In addition, the seq2seq method was demonstrated to be an effective method for time series predictions in hydrology.},

  abstract = {Quantitative analysis of changes in Lhasa River runoff components was significant to local water resources management. This study constructed the spatial processes in hydrology (SPHY) model in the Lhasa River Basin and optimized the model's parameters using the hydrograph partitioning curves (HPC) method. The Lhasa River Basin's precipitation and temperature were forecasted for 2020 to 2100 using the statistical downscaling model (SDSM) and two scenarios from the fifth generation of the Canadian earth system model (CanESM5) dataset, shared socioeconomic pathways 1-2.6 (SSP1-2.6) and shared socioeconomic pathways 2-4.5 (SSP2-4.5). This study analyzed the potential changes in Lhasa River runoff and components based on the future climate. The results showed that the Lhasa River runoff from 2010 to 2019 was composed of snowmelt runoff, glacier melt runoff, rainfall runoff, and baseflow, with the proportions of 15.57, 6.19, 49.98, and 28.26\%, respectively. From 2020 to 2100, under the SSP1-2.6 scenario, the precipitation and average temperature increased by 0.76mm and 0.08 degrees C per decade. Under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, the increasing rate was 3.57 mm and 0.25 degrees C per decade. Due to the temperature increase, snowmelt and glacier melt runoff showed a decreasing trend. The decline rate of total runoff was 0.31 m(3)/s per year under the SSP1-2.6 scenario due to the decrease in baseflow. Under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, total runoff and rainfall runoff showed a clear increasing trend at an average rate of 1.13 and 1.16 m(3)/s per year, respectively, related to the significant increase in precipitation. These conclusions suggested that climate change significantly impacted the Lhasa River's total runoff and runoff components.},

  abstract = {Distributed hydrological models have been developed to describe temporal and spatial variations. However, it is difficult to calibrate the spatially heterogeneous parameters because of dimensional issues and spatial uncertainty. This study aims to propose a dimension-adaptive key grid (DAKG) calibration strategy to identify spatial parameters of distributed hydrological models. The method uses sensitivity analyses to find important model parameters, and significantly fewer grid points are then selected as representative grids to reduce the dimensionality of parameters. Apart from the observed outlet streamflow, grid actual evaporation, and grid runoff are used for the multi-objective calibration framework. The Xiangjiang basin, the Yuanjiang basin, and the source region of the Yellow River in China are used as case studies, where the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land surface models have been calibrated. The results indicate that: (1) The proposed DAKG calibration strategy improves performance in terms of accuracy and model complexity for hydrological simulation. (2) The spatial distributions of the shape parameter B and the thickness of the second soil layer Depth2 are easy to be identified, where the spatial distribution of Depth2 is the most positively correlated with that of elevation. (3) The fusion of the runoff and evaporation products helps to reduce the uncertainty of the distributed parameters. Overall, the DAKG calibration strategy is an effective technique for parameter identification in distributed hydrological models.},

  abstract = {Groundwater-sustained baseflow is a vital source of river flow, especially during dry seasons. The proportion of river flow sustained by baseflow-the baseflow index-is essential for assessing fluvial nutrient cycling and contaminant transport. However, the global baseflow index remains highly uncertain, with current Earth system model simulations ranging from 12\% to 94\%. Here we estimate the global baseflow index to be 59\% +/- 7\% based on an emergent constraint approach, which integrates 50 Earth system models with baseflow indices derived from streamflow observations in 15,567 basins. Our observational constraint indicates that at least 21\% +/- 3\% of precipitation recharges groundwater, which is approximately double the figure reported in the Sixth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Thus, our research suggests a more active role of groundwater in the global water cycle than most Earth system models currently simulate. We present evidence that the considerable disagreement in simulated baseflow stems from unrealistic and varied model representations of infiltration, aquifer structure and groundwater dynamics. These processes should be prioritized so that models can capture active groundwater-river connections. Groundwater supplies about 59\% of global river flow, suggesting a larger contribution of groundwater to the global water cycle than currently appreciated, according to an analysis integrating estimates from models and observations.},

  abstract = {Quantifying precipitation (P) partition into evapotranspiration (E) and runoff (Q) is of great importance for global and regional water availability assessment. Budyko framework serves as a powerful tool to make simple and transparent estimation for the partition, using a single parameter, to characterize the shape of the Budyko curve for a "specific basin", where the single parameter reflects the overall effect by not only climatic seasonality, catchment characteristics (e.g., soil, topography and vegetation) but also agricultural activities (e.g., cultivation and irrigation). At the regional scale, these influencing factors are interconnected, and the interactions between them can also affect the single parameter of Budyko-type equations' estimating. Here we employ the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) model to estimate the Budyko curve shape parameter (n in the Choudhury's equation, one form of the Budyko framework) of the selected 96 catchments across China using a data set of long-term averages for climatic seasonality, catchment characteristics and agricultural activities. Results show average storm depth (ASD), vegetation coverage (M), and seasonality index of precipitation (SI) are three statistically significant factors affecting the Budyko parameter. More importantly, four pairs of interactions are recognized by the MARS model as: The interaction between CA (percentage of cultivated land area to total catchment area) and ASD shows that the cultivation can weaken the reducing effect of high ASD ({$>$}46.78 mm) on the Budyko parameter estimating. Drought (represented by the value of Palmer drought severity index {$<$}-0.74) and uneven distribution of annual rainfall (represented by the value of coefficient of variation of precipitation {$>$} 0.23) tend to enhance the Budyko parameter reduction by large SI ({$>$}0.797). Low vegetation coverage (34.56\%) is likely to intensify the rising effect on evapotranspiration ratio by IA (percentage of irrigation area to total catchment area). The Budyko n values estimated by the MARS model reproduce the calculated ones by the observation well for the selected 96 catchments (with R = 0.817, MAE = 4.09). Compared to the multiple stepwise regression model estimating the parameter n taken the influencing factors as independent inputs, the MARS model enhances the capability of the Budyko framework for assessing water availability at regional scale using readily available data.

The spatiotemporal variations in hydrologic variables (i.e., runoff, precipitation and potential evaporation) during historical period were revealed first and the climate elasticities of runoff were investigated. The proposed climate elasticity method was also applied to project the spatiotemporal variations in future runoff and its key influencing factors in 35 watersheds across China. Wherein, the future climate series were retrieved by consulting the historical series, informed by four global climate models (GCMs) under representative concentration pathways from phase five of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Wang-Tang equation was selected as the optimal Budykotype equation for its best ability in reproducing the runoff change (with a coefficient of determination and mean absolute error of 0.998 and 1.36 mm, respectively). Observed runoff presents significant decreasing trends in the northern and increasing trends in the southern regions of China, and generally its change is identified to be more sensitive to climatic variables in Hai River Basin and lower Yellow River Basin. Compared to the runoff during the reference period, positive change rates in the north and negative change rates in the south of China in the mid-21st century can be practically generalized from the majority of GCMs projections. This maybe resulted from the increasing precipitation, especially in parts of northern basins. Meanwhile, GCMs project a consistently upward trend in potential evaporation although significant decreasing trends occur in the majority of catchments for the historical period. The results indicate that climate change will possibly bring some changes to the water resources over China in the mid-21st century and some countermeasures of water resources planning and management should be taken.},

Here, we combine observation-based runoff and precipitation datasets to quantify basin-averaged RC changes in 433 major global river basins during the period 1985--2014. Thereafter, the ratios of terrestrial water storage changes and evaporation to precipitation (SC and EC, respectively) are obtained to evaluate the factors driving the RC changes. The results show that 12.93\% of the basins experience significant decreasing trends in RC, with slopes ranging from -0.55 {\textpm} 0.17\% yr-1 to -0.05 {\textpm} 0.02\% yr-1, while 6.47\% basins show increasing RCs with slopes ranging from 0.09 {\textpm} 0.04\% yr-1 to 0.56 {\textpm} 0.17\% yr-1. A higher percentage (62.95\%) of basins reveal decreasing RCs for the regions with considerable human intervention compared to those (58.24\%) with dominant natural variability. Changes in EC dominate the RC changes over 79.68\% of the basins for both increasing and decreasing trends, with a maximum contribution (53.65\%) from transpiration, among other partitioned components. Corroborated inferences from explicit investigation in the Yangtze River basin highlight the robustness of our results for global water managers and policymakers.},

  abstract = {Hydrological model parameters are essential for model simulation, which may vary with time owing to climatic variations and human activities. As a result, the implementation of stationary parameters may lead to inaccurate streamflow simulation. Actual evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial component of hydrological cycles with an important influence on regional climate characteristics. Our aim was to investigate an appropriate way to estimate time-varying parameters using streamflow and ET observations, and to explore the how the simulation efficiency would change when ET data were added into assimilation. Data assimilation techniques can automatically adjust hydrological model parameters according to changing conditions. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique was used to assimilate observations into a two-parameter monthly water balance model. Four data assimilation schemes were designed and applied in a synthetic experiment and 173 catchments in USA, including: (1) sole assimilation of streamflow to update both parameters, (2) joint assimilation of streamflow and ET to simultaneously update parameters, (3) sole assimilation of ET first to update parameter C (measuring evapotranspiration), and then subsequently joint assimilation of streamflow and ET to update parameter SC (measuring water storage capacity), and (4) sole assimilation of ET to update parameter C, and then sole assimilation of streamflow to update parameter SC. The four schemes were compared in terms of deterministic and probabilistic model performances, and model parameter correlations. The results indicated that: (1) the estimation of parameter C can be improved by assimilating ET observations into the model, and the time-varying model parameters obtained by adding ET data into assimilation led to a significant enhancement in deterministic streamflow and ET prediction, (2) among the three joint assimilation schemes, the deterministic model simulation performances were similar, while the ensemble predictions were more reliable in scheme 2. The joint assimilation of streamflow and ET to update both parameters in one step, i.e., scheme 2, outperformed the other two schemes in parameter SC estimation and model performance, (3) the ability to enhance simulation accuracy and to weaken correlations between parameters was more significant in humid catchments. The joint assimilation was helpful for the application of multiple sources of information into a hydrological simulation.},

  abstract = {Catchment hydrological processes have been greatly influenced by the intensive variability in land use/cover, precipitation and air temperature due to climate change and local human activities. It is desired to understand catchment hydrological response to these changes. Observations show that annual runoff had a significant decreasing trend during the past 50 years (1956-2005) in Haihe basin of northern China. In order to detect the major cause for this runoff decline, we first theoretically derived the elasticity of runoff from the Choudhury-Yang equation that is a water-energy balance equation based on the Budyko hypothesis. The elasticity of runoff was calculated in 33 selected mountainous catchments in Haihe basin based on their climate condition (represented by the aridity index, E-0/P) and landscape condition (represented by the parameter, n). We analyzed the breakpoint of the annual runoff of the 33 catchments over the past 50 years and split the whole study period into two sub-periods at the breakpoint (period 1: before the breakpoint; period 2: after the breakpoint). Then we attributed the runoff change between the two sub-periods to the impacts of climate variability and land use/cover change. The change of climate is represented by changes in precipitation (P) and potential evaporation (E-0) and the change of land use/cover is represented by the parameter n in Choudhury-Yang equation. The change of annual runoff from period-1 to period-2 was the catchment hydrological response to the change of precipitation, potential evaporation and land use/cover (represented as Delta P, Delta E-0 and Delta n), and we calculated the runoff change based on the elasticities of runoff. For the 33 catchments, the mean annual runoff decreased by 43.0 mm from the period-1 (91.4 mm) to period-2 (48.4 mm). Impacts of climate variation and land use/cover change were accountable for the runoff decrease by 26.9\% and 73.1\% on average, respectively. Impact of climate variation mainly came from the decrease in precipitation, and impact of land use/cover change mainly came from the vegetation increase. Vegetation increase was mainly due to the reforestation during the soil-water conservation practice during the past 30 years and also partially due to climate variability especially the temperature increase. This methodology can also be used to predict the runoff change in these catchments without direct influence of local human activities under the future climate scenario based on the climate elasticity of runoff estimated from the historical hydroclimatic data.

The dataset is based on the interpolation from 751 observing stations in China and comprises 3 variables: daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. The "anomaly approach" is applied in the interpolation. The gridded climatology of 1971-2000 is first calculated and then a gridded daily anomaly for 1961-2005 is added to the climatology to obtain the final dataset. Comparison of the dataset with CRU (Climatic Research Unit) observations at the monthly scale shows general agreement between the two datasets. The differences found can be largely attributed to the introduction of observations at new stations. The dataset shows similar interannual variability as does CRU data over North China and eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau, but with a slightly larger linear trend. The dataset is employed to validate the simulation of three extreme indices based on daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperature by a high-resolution regional climate model. Results show that the model reproduces these indices well. The data are available at the National Climate Center of China Meteorological Administration, and a coarser resolution (1 degrees x 1 degrees) version can be accessed via the World Wide Web.},

  abstract = {The Yangtze River and the Huang River are the two largest rivers in China. Annual runoff ratios (runoff/precipitation, denoted as RR) of the head regions of these two basins (HYR and HHR, respectively) have significantly decreased over the past several decades, closely related to changes in water storage capacity (WSC) and terrestrial water storage (TWS). However, such effects have rarely been quantified due to limitations associated with complicated arctic hydrological processes and the absence of long-term reliable TWS data. In this study, a TWS reconstruction dataset (TWSrec) was validated, and demonstrated good performance in capturing TWS variations derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and in the terrestrial water budget for these two head regions. Long-term (1980-2015) changes in TWS and WSC were then detected and their effects on RR were quantified through trend detection, change point analysis, and path analysis. Results showed that TWS increased significantly with a rate of 27.6 mm/10 yr and 19.8 mm/10 yr at HYR and HHR, respectively. These increases were mainly caused by wetting (increases in precipitation) or soil moisture increases from the TWS component perspective. WSC (represented as the ratio of TWS to precipitation) gradually enlarged in response to continuous climate warming. RR decreased significantly with rates of 2.0\%/10 yr at HYR and 3.6\%/10 yr at HHR, attributed to the increased evaporation ratio (similar to 80\%) and increased WSC (similar to 20\%) in both head regions. Further analysis suggested that permafrost degradation under climate warming could increase WSC. These results demonstrate that climate change has resulted in unstable terrestrial water storage at HYR and HHR, and that increases in WSC due to permafrost degradation play an important role in accurately simulating runoff in the Tibetan Plateau and other permafrost-degradation regions.},

In this study, the Budyko framework was revised and applied at a finer spatio-temporal scale for the simulation and attribution of monthly ET variability in dry regions. As a holistic approach for modeling water partitioning, the revised Budyko framework (RBF) is expected to achieve parsimony of data input and model parameters. Application of the Budyko-based framework in the APENC showed an accurate ET simulation (R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 3.45 mm/mon, NSE = 0.95), which is a better performance compared with two classical models, FAO crop coefficient model and Complimentary Relationship (CR) model with in situ observations. For the attribution of monthly ET variability, vegetation has the highest sensitivity coefficient, while the precipitation shows the largest actual contribution because of its larger variability. Subsequently, the RBF was assessed with two different groups of in situ observations in semi-arid areas with different environment and vegetation conditions, and showed credible results on ET simulation. This shows that the RBF with parsimony of model parameters is highly applicable in data lacking dry regions.},

Here we develop a universal model to predict water-energy partitioning ( parameter for the Fu's equation, one form of the Budyko framework) which spans small to large scale basins globally. A neural network (NN) model was developed using a data set of 224 small U.S. basins (100-10,000 km(2)) and 32 large, global basins (230,000-600,000 km(2)) independently and combined based on both local (slope, normalized difference vegetation index) and global (geolocation) factors. The Budyko framework with NN estimated reproduced observed mean annual ET well for the combined 256 basins. The predicted mean annual ET for 36,600 global basins is in good agreement (R-2=0.72) with an independent global satellite-based ET product, inversely validating the NN model. The NN model enhances the capability of the Budyko framework for assessing water availability at global scales using readily available data.},

  abstract = {The ability of water balance models to incorporate month-month or seasonal variations in climate, snowfall and snowmelt, groundwater fluctuations, soil moisture characteristics, and natural climatic variability makes them especially attractive for water resources studies of climatic changes. The use of conceptual models to explore the impact of climate changes has increased in recent years. Because of the success claimed for these studies, it is likely that computer simulation of catchments will increasingly be used by and for water resource managers as an aid to decision-making. There is therefore a need for a generally accepted method for demonstrating a model's fitness for such use. The simple split-sample test method may be reasonable in the simplest case of the 'filling-in missing data' problem but certainly not if the express purpose of the model is to simulate records for conditions different from those corresponding to the calibration record, such as the problem with predicting the effects of climate changes where the data on the changed system are not (and cannot be) available for comparison with the model predictions. Thus, model validation must demonstrate 'fitness for the said purpose'. In this paper, available model validation methods are reviewed and the hierarchical scheme for systematic testing of hydrological simulation models according to the modelling tasks, proposed by Klemes (1986) (Klemes, V., 1986. Hydrol. Sci. J. 31, 13-24) is discussed in detail and exemplified using the NOPEX water balance model (Xu, C.-Y., Seibert, J., Halldin, S., 1996. J. Hydrol. 180, 211-236) and NOPEX data.

The model outputs are monthly river flow and other water balance components, such as actual evapotranspiration, slow and fast components of river flow, snow accumulation and melting. The results suggest that the proposed model structure is suitable for water balance study purposes in seasonally snow-covered catchments located in the region.},

Significant improvements were found in flat regions where height errors larger than topography variability, and landscapes such as river networks and hill-valley structures, became clearly represented. We found the topography slope of previous DEMs was largely distorted in most of world major floodplains (e.g., Ganges, Nile, Niger, and Mekong) and swamp forests (e.g., Amazon, Congo, and Vasyugan).

  abstract = {Global river models are an essential tool for both earth system studies and water resources assessments. As advanced physical processes have been implemented in global river models, increasing computational cost has become problematic for executing ensemble or long-term simulations. To improve computational efficiency, we here propose the use of a local inertial flow equation combined with a vector-based river network map. A local inertial equation, a simplified formulation of the shallow water equations, was introduced to replace a diffusion wave equation. A vector-based river network map which flexibly discretizes river segments was adopted in order to replace the traditional grid-based map which is based on a Cartesian grid coordinate system. The computational efficiency of the proposed flow routing and river network map was tested by executing hydrodynamic simulations with the CaMa-Flood global river model. The simulation results suggest that the computational efficiency can be improved by more than 300\% by applying the local inertial equation. It can be improved by a further 60\% by implementing the vector-based river network map instead of a grid-based map. It is found that the vector-based map with evenly distributed flow distances between calculation units allows longer time steps compared to the grid-based map because the latter has very short flow distances between calculation units at high latitudes which critically limit time step length. Considering the improvement in simulation speed, the local inertial equation, and a vector-based river network map are preferable in global hydrodynamic simulations with high computational demands such as ensemble or long-term experiments.},

  abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is the roof of the world and water towers of Asia. However, research on hydrological processes is restricted by the sparse gauge network in the TP. The distributed hydrological model is an efficient tool to explore hydrological processes. Meanwhile, the spatial distribution of precipitation directly affects the precision of distributed hydrological modelling. The latest TRMM 3B42 (V7) precipitation was evaluated compared with gauge precipitation at station and basin scales in the Naqu River Basin of the TP. The results show that Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation overestimated the precipitation with BIAS of 0.2; the intensity distributions of daily precipitation are consistent in the two precipitation data. TRMM precipitation was then corrected by the good linear relation between monthly areal TRMM precipitation and gauge precipitation, and applied into the Water and Energy Process model. The results indicate that the simulated streamflow using both precipitation data produce a good fit with observed streamflow, especially at monthly scale. Furthermore, the better relations between average slopes and runoff coefficients of sub-basins from the corrected TRMM precipitation-based model implies that the spatial distribution of TRMM precipitation is closer to the spatial distribution of actual precipitation, and has an advantage in driving distributed hydrological models.},

  abstract = {Land cover (LC) determines the energy exchange, water and carbon cycle between Earth's spheres. Accurate LC information is a fundamental parameter for the environment and climate studies. Considering that the LC in China has been altered dramatically with the economic development in the past few decades, sequential and fine-scale LC monitoring is in urgent need. However, currently, fine-resolution annual LC dataset produced by the observational images is generally unavailable for China due to the lack of sufficient training samples and computational capabilities. To deal with this issue, we produced the first Landsat-derived annual China land cover dataset (CLCD) on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, which contains 30 m annual LC and its dynamics in China from 1990 to 2019. We first collected the training samples by combining stable samples extracted from China's land-use/cover datasets (CLUDs) and visually interpreted samples from satellite time-series data, Google Earth and Google Maps. Using 335 709 Landsat images on the GEE, several temporal metrics were constructed and fed to the random forest classifier to obtain classification results. We then proposed a post-processing method incorporating spatial--temporal filtering and logical reasoning to further improve the spatial--temporal consistency of CLCD. Finally, the overall accuracy of CLCD reached 79.31 \% based on 5463 visually interpreted samples. A further assessment based on 5131 third-party test samples showed that the overall accuracy of CLCD outperforms that of MCD12Q1, ESACCI\_LC, FROM\_GLC and GlobeLand30. Besides, we intercompared the CLCD with several Landsat-derived thematic products, which exhibited good consistencies with the Global Forest Change, the Global Surface Water, and three impervious surface products. Based on the CLCD, the trends and patterns of China's LC changes during 1985 and 2019 were revealed, such as expansion of impervious surface (+148.71 \%) and water (+18.39 \%), decrease in cropland (-4.85 \%) and grassland (-3.29 \%), and increase in forest (+4.34 \%). In general, CLCD reflected the rapid urbanization and a series of ecological projects (e.g. Gain for Green) in China and revealed the anthropogenic implications on LC under the condition of climate change, signifying its potential application in the global change research. The CLCD dataset introduced in this article is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4417810 (Yang and Huang, 2021).},

Focus Climate change and human activities have altered the type of land use in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), which has affected the variation laws of water resources. We calibrated and verified the Water and Energy Transfer Process for a Large basin model (WEP-L), and calculated the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff change and separated the impact of land use. New hydrological insights The Archimedean Copula function was used to diagnose the variance between precipitation and runoff. The contribution of climate change to the runoff in the Dasa and Jiayuqiao subbasin was 81.7\% and 71.5\%, of which the contribution of land use was 39.3\% and 32.6\%, respectively. Human activities contributing to the runoff in the Dasa and Jiayuqiao subbasins were 18.3\% and 28.5\%, of which the contribution of land use is 7.9\% and 2.8\%, respectively. Climate change has led to the melting of glaciers, permanent permafrost and the shift of the vertical distribution of vegetation, which is the main reason for the runoff variation in the NRB. This research provides a scientific basis for the rational protection and utilization of water resources, as well as soil and water conservation work.},

  abstract = {[1] On the basis of long time series of climate and discharge in 108 nonhumid catchments in China this study analyzes the spatial and temporal variability of annual water-energy balance using the Budyko hypothesis. For both long-term means and annual values of the water balances in the 108 catchments, Fu's formula derived from the Budyko hypothesis is confirmed. A high correlation and relatively small systematic error between the values of parameter v in Fu's equation optimized from the water balance of individual year and calibrated from the long-term mean water balance show that Fu's equation can be used for predicting the interannual variability of regional water balances. It has been found that besides the annual climate conditions the regional pattern of annual water-energy balance is also closely correlated with the relative infiltration capacity (K-s/i(r)), relative soil water storage (S-max/E-0), and the average slope ( tan beta). This enables one to estimate the parameter v from catchment characteristics without calibration from the long time series of water balances. An empirical formula for the parameter v in terms of the dimensionless landscape parameters is proposed. Applications of Fu's equation together with the parameter v estimated by this empirical formula have shown that Fu's equation can predict both long-term mean and annual value of actual evapotranspiration accurately and predict both long-term mean and interannual variability of runoff reasonably. This implies that the Fu's equation can be used for predicting the annual water balance in ungauged basins.},

  abstract = {Multi-source soil moisture (SM) products provide a vigorous tool for the estimation of soil moisture on a large scale, but it is crucial to carry out the evaluation of those products before further application. In the present work, an evaluation framework on multi-source SM datasets over central and eastern agricultural areas of China was firstly proposed, based on a dense in situ SM monitoring network of 838 stations from 11 July 2012 to 31 December 2017. Each station adopted the most accurate gravimetric method for measuring the actual soil moisture. The effects of land use types and wet--dry conditions on the performances of multi-source SM products were further analyzed. Most satellite/reanalysis SM products could capture the spatial--temporal changes in soil moisture, especially for ERA5 products that matched the closest to the station-measured SM; by contrast, those satellite products showed poor spatial--temporal performances. Such phenomenon was also quantitatively demonstrated by the four statistical metrics correlation coefficient (CC), p-value, bias and root mean squared error (RMSE) between the satellite/reanalysis SM products and the ground-observed SM series. Further, most satellite/reanalysis SM products had poor performances in Forestland and Grassland areas, with a lower CC and a larger positive bias and RMSE. Such overestimation on soil moisture is possibly influenced by the inestimable parameter vegetation geometry and the vegetation water content in the radiative transfer models. The arid areas showed the worst CC between the station-observed SM data and different satellite/reanalysis SM products; meanwhile, the humid and semi-arid areas presented larger SM estimation errors than the other areas, especially for the satellite products. The fairly dry surface soil (arid area) and open water surface contamination (humid area) are suggested to hinder the reading of microwavebased retrieval systems. Additionally, the reanalysis SM products outperformed the satellite SM products in the evaluated areas, with better spatial--temporal performances, seasonality reflection and higher accuracy on SM estimation (higher CC, and lower bias and RMSE). This is because the reanalysis datasets assimilated various sources of datasets, especially the ground-observed data, with high quality. The evaluated results could provide guidance for fusing different satellite/reanalysis products, as a new feasible alternative to monitoring SM information in the future.},

  abstract = {The growth of vegetation is affected by water availability, while vegetation growth also feeds back to influence regional water balance. A better understanding of the relationship between vegetation state and water balance would help explain the complicated interactions between climate change, vegetation dynamics, and the water cycle. In the present study, the impact of vegetation coverage on regional water balance was analyzed under the framework of the Budyko hypothesis by using data from 99 catchments in the nonhumid regions of China, including the Inland River basin, the Hai River basin, and the Yellow River basin. The distribution of vegetation coverage on the Budyko curve was analyzed, and it was found that a wetter environment (higher P/E0) had a higher vegetation coverage (M) and was associated with a higher evapotranspiration efficiency (E/E0). Moreover, vegetation coverage was related not only to climate conditions (measured by the dryness index DI = E0/P) but also to landscape conditions (measured by the parameter n in the coupled water--energy balance equation). This suggests that the regional long-term water balance should not vary along a single Budyko curve; instead, it should form a group of Budyko curves owing to the interactions between vegetation, climate, and water cycle. A positive correlation was found between water balance component (E/P) and vegetation coverage (M) for most of the Yellow River basin and for the Inland River basin, while a negative correlation of M {$\sim$} E/P was found in the Hai River basin. Vegetation coverage was successfully incorporated into an empirical equation for estimating the catchment landscape parameter n in the coupled water--energy balance equation. It was found that interannual variability in vegetation coverage could improve the estimation of the interannual variability in regional water balance.},

In this paper, using Fu's equation for annual water-energy balances at the catchment scale, which was derived phenomenologically and mathematically on the basis of the Budyko hypothesis, consistency among the three hypotheses is explained. In non-humid regions, change of actual evaporation is dominated by change in precipitation rather than potential evaporation, and the Bouchet complementary relationship between actual evaporation and potential evaporation comes about because actual evaporation and potential evaporation are correlated via precipitation. The annual water balances in 108 non-humid catchments of China have been examined as part of this study, and the results supported the complementary relationship. In humid regions, change in actual evaporation is controlled by change in potential evaporation rather than precipitation, and this is identical to the Penman hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Analyzing climate change impacts on hydrology and future water supply projections is essential for effective water resource management and planning in the large river basins of Asia. In these regions, streamflow and glacier melt remain subject to significant uncertainties due to the lack of confidence in climate change projections and modeling methods. In this study, a glacier dynamics model (the Open Global Glacier Model was coupled with a glacio-hydrological model [the Glacio-hydrological Degree-day Model (GDM)] to predict possible hydrological changes in the head watershed of the Urumqi River under three shared socioeconomic pathways SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. The GDM was calibrated and validated against in situ observed discharge data for the 2007-2011 and 2012-2018 periods. The resulting Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values were 0.82 and 0.81, respectively. The GDM was driven with an ensemble of five downscaled CMIP6 datasets to examine the potential impacts of climate change on hydrologic processes in the basin. Four runoff components were simulated with the GDM: base flow, rainfall, ice melt, and snow melt. It was determined that rainfall constituted the predominant source of runoff, followed by baseflow and ice melt. During the calibration and validation periods, snow and ice melt contributed 25.14 and 25.62\%, respectively, to the total runoff. Under all SSP scenarios, the projected runoff decline indicated that the peak runoff time had passed. It was revealed that a 2 degrees C increase in the monthly average temperature could result in a 37.7\% increase in the total discharge of the basin. Moreover, the GDM was more responsive to changes in air temperature than to changes in glacier extent.},

  abstract = {The climate elasticity of runoff is an important indicator that is used to quantify the relationship between changes in runoff and changes in climate variables. It is a function of both climate and catchment characteristics. Recently, Yang and Yang (2011) proposed an analytical derivation of climate elasticity (YY2011), in which a parameter n was used to represent the impact of the catchment characteristics. In China, both climate and catchment characteristics have large spatial variations. To understand the spatial variation of hydrologic response to climate change, this paper divided China into 210 catchments, further calculated the parameter n, and then estimated the climate elasticity and evaluated the contribution of climate change to runoff for each catchment. The results show that n ranges from 0.4 to 3.8 (with a mean of 1.3 and a standard deviation of 0.6), which has a logarithmic relationship with catchment slope; the precipitation elasticity ranges from 1.1 to 4.8 (with a mean of 1.9 and a standard deviation of 0.6), which shows a large regional variation, smaller values (1.1-2.0) mainly appearing in Southern China, the Songhua River basin and the Northwest, and larger values (2.1-4.8) mainly appearing in the Hai River basin, the Liao River basin and the Yellow River basin. In addition, climate contribution to runoff exhibits a large regional variation, the largest positive values (1.1-3.1\%/a) occurring in the Northwest, the largest negative values (-1.0 to -0.5\%/a) occurring in the Hai River basin and the middle reach of the Yellow River basin. In theory, the YY2011 method is a first-order approximation. The approximation underestimates the precipitation (P) contribution to runoff when P increases and overestimates that when P decreases, and the relative error has a median of similar to 3\% and a maximum of similar to 20\% when 10\% precipitations change in those catchments of China.

  abstract = {Identifying the effect of climate variability and human activities on runoff changes is scientifically essential for understanding hydrological processes and sustainable water resources management. This study selected 64 catchments located in the mainland of China to quantify the effects of different driving forces on runoff changes. Results showed that annual runoff in the Haihe river basin, Liaohe river basin, and Yellow river basin exhibited significantly decreasing trends from 1965 to 2018 (P {$<$} 0.05), whereas the Northwest river basin had positive trends in the annual runoff. Meanwhile, the Pettitt test method was applied to detect abrupt changes in annual runoff. Compared to the rivers in Southern China, the northern rivers had significant abrupt changes in annual runoff and mostly occurred in the 1990 s. The Choudhury-Yang equation based on the Budyko hypothesis was used to assess the sensitivity of runoff to precipitation (P), potential evapotranspiration (ET0), and the land surface (n) changes. The results showed that runoff was more sensitive to P and n, compared to ET0. Attribution analysis revealed that P was the dominant factor in the Northwest river basin, Southwest river basin, Yangtze river basin, Southeast river basin, and Pearl river basin, whereas the changes in n were responsible for runoff changes in the Liaohe river basin, Haihe river basin, Yellow river Basin, Songhuajiang river basin, and Huaihe river basin. The land surface changes (n) were resulted from vegetation restoration, urbanization expansion, construction of reservoirs/check dams, and surface water withdrawals, leading to significant changes in river runoff in recent years. The findings can provide good insight for water resources management across China.},

  abstract = {Snowmelt is a major fresh water resource, and quantifying snowmelt and its variability under climate change is necessary for the planning and management of water resources. Spatiotemporal changes in snow properties in China have drawn wide attention in recent decades; however, country-wide assessments of snowmelt are lacking. Using precipitation and temperature data with a high spatial resolution (0.5{$\prime$}; approximately 1 km), this study calculated the monthly snowmelt in China for the 1951--2017 period, using a simple temperature index model, and the model outputs were validated using snowfall, snow depth, snow cover extent and snow water equivalent. Precipitation and temperature scenarios developed from five CMIP5 models were used to predict future snowmelt in China under three different representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The results show that the mean annual snowmelt in China from 1951 to 2017 is 2.41{\texttimes}1011 m3 yr-1. The mean annual snowmelt values in Northern Xinjiang, Northeast China and the Tibetan Plateau -- China's three main stable snow cover regions -- are 0.18{\texttimes}1011, 0.42{\texttimes}1011 and 1.15{\texttimes}1011 m3 yr-1, respectively. From 1951 to 2017, the snowmelt increased significantly in the Tibetan Plateau and decreased significantly in northern, central and southeastern China. In the whole of China, there was a decreasing trend in snowmelt, but this was not statistically significant. The mean annual snowmelt runoff ratios are generally more than 10 \% in almost all third-level basins in West China, more than 5 \% in third-level basins in North and Northeast China and less than 2 \% in third-level basins in South China. From 1951 to 2017, the annual snowmelt runoff ratios decreased in most third-level basins in China. Under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the projected snowmelt in China in the near future (2011--2040; mid-future --2041--2070; far future -- 2071--2099) may decrease by 10.4 \% (15.8 \%; 13.9 \%), 12.0 \% (17.9 \%; 21.1 \%) and 11.7 \% (24.8 \%; 36.5 \%) compared to the reference period (1981--2010), respectively. Most of the projected mean annual snowmelt runoff ratios in third-level basins in different future periods are lower than those in the reference period. Low temperature regions can tolerate more warming, and the snowmelt change in these regions is mainly influenced by precipitation; however, the snowmelt change in warm regions is more sensitive to temperature increases. The spatial variability in snowmelt changes may lead to regional differences in the impact of snowmelt on water supply.},

Based on the parameterization and validation of a process-based ecosystem model (Terrestrial Ecosystem Model, TEM5.0), we analyze temporal and spatial dynamics and patterns of grassland ecosystem carbon emission and sequestration of Tibetan Plateau in China from 1961 to 2010. Alpine grasslands act as a carbon sink with mean annual value of 10.12 Tg C yr(-1) during the past 50 years. The alpine meadow contributes most to the sink at 9.04 Tg C yr(-1), while the alpine steppe only contributes 2.03 Tg C yr(-1). 83.7\% of the total area trends to be carbon sink and only 0.2\% of the region showed no significant trend. Furthermore, the annual net ecosystem productivity shows significantly positive relationship with increasing temperature and atmosphere CO2 concentration, but it shows no significant relationship with precipitation. Alpine grasslands in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is a carbon sink and sequestrate totally 520 Tg C from 1961 to 2010. The carbon budget of alpine experienced dramatically spatial and temporal dynamics during past 50 years. Inter-annual variability of the net ecosystem productivity mainly depends on different sensitivities of net primary productivity and heterotrophic respiration to temperature and precipitation variability. Temperature and atmosphere CO2 concentration are main driving forces of carbon budget dynamics of grassland ecosystems in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau during 1961-2010. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The traditional treatment of uncertainty in hydrological modelling primarily attributes it to model parameters, but rarely systematically considers meteorological input errors, especially in quantifying the impact of meteorological input errors on parameter uncertainty. This study developed a Bayesian-based integrated approach to quantitatively investigate uncertainties in meteorological inputs (precipitation and temperature) and model parameters as well as the variation in parameter uncertainty due to meteorological input errors. Additionally, we analysed the propagation from these uncertainties to runoff response in snowmelt and non-snowmelt periods. The applicability and advantages of this approach were presented by applying of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to the Shitoukoumen Reservoir Catchment. Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis-Markov Chain Monte Carlo was applied for the straightforward Bayesian inference the uncertainties of meteorological inputs and model parameters. On this basis, multilevel factorial analysis technology was used to quantitatively investigate the specific impact of the model parameters' individual and interactive effects due to meteorological input errors. Finally, the impact of meteorological input errors and model parameter uncertainty on the model performance were analysed and quantified systematically. The results showed that the meteorological input errors could affect the random characteristics of multiple model parameters. Moreover, meteorological input errors could further affect the model parameters' effects on annual average runoff. Overall, the above results have significant implications in enhancing hydrological model to simulate/predict runoff and understanding hydrological processes during different periods. The key findings of this study were summarized:The meteorological input errors influenced the related hydrological processes such as overland runoff, snow melting, and evaporation.The meteorological input errors tend to affect the interaction between hydrological processes.Comprehensive consideration of the meteorological input error and model parameter uncertainty is helpful to improve the simulation/prediction ability of hydrological models.image},

  abstract = {The Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalayan system, named the Third Pole because it is the largest global store of frozen water after the polar regions, provides a reliable water supply to almost 2 billion people. Marked atmospheric warming has changed the balance of this so-called Asian water tower and altered water resources in downstream countries. In this Review, we synthesize observational evidence and model projections that describe an imbalance in the Asian water tower caused by accelerated transformation of ice and snow into liquid water. This phase change is associated with a south-north disparity due to the spatio-temporal interaction between the westerlies and the Indian monsoon. A corresponding spatial imbalance is exhibited by alterations in freshwater resources in endorheic or exorheic basins. Global warming is expected to amplify this imbalance, alleviating water scarcity in the Yellow and Yangtze River basins and increasing scarcity in the Indus and Amu Darya River basins. However, the future of the Asian water tower remains highly uncertain. Accurate predictions of future water supply require the establishment of comprehensive monitoring stations in data-scarce regions and the development of advanced coupled atmosphere-cryosphere-hydrology models. Such models are needed to inform the development of actionable policies for sustainable water resource management. Atmospheric warming has imbalanced the Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalayan system (the Asian water tower (AWT)). Yao et al. review observed changes in atmospheric water and freshwater AWT constituents, focusing on their future consequences for freshwater resources and vulnerable societies across downstream basins.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The Third Pole (TP) is experiencing rapid warming and is currently in its warmest period in the past 2,000 years. This paper reviews the latest development in multidisciplinary TP research associated with this warming. The rapid warming facilitates intense and broad glacier melt over most of the TP, although some glaciers in the northwest are advancing. By heating the atmosphere and reducing snow/ice albedo, aerosols also contribute to the glaciers melting. Glacier melt is accompanied by lake expansion and intensification of the water cycle over the TP. Precipitation has increased over the eastern and northwestern TP. Meanwhile, the TP is greening and most regions are experiencing advancing phenological trends, although over the southwest there is a spring phenological delay mainly in response to the recent decline in spring precipitation. Atmospheric and terrestrial thermal and dynamical processes over the TP affect the Asian monsoon at different scales. Recent evidence indicates substantial roles that mesoscale convective systems play in the TP's precipitation as well as an association between soil moisture anomalies in the TP and the Indian monsoon. Moreover, an increase in geohazard events has been associated with recent environmental changes, some of which have had catastrophic consequences caused by glacial lake outbursts and landslides. Active debris flows are growing in both frequency of occurrences and spatial scale. Meanwhile, new types of disasters, such as the twin ice avalanches in Ali in 2016, are now appearing in the region. Adaptation and mitigation measures should be taken to help societies' preparation for future environmental challenges. Some key issues for future TP studies are also discussed.},

This study uses five CMIP6 global climate models (GCMs) to drive the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model, and then simulates the hydrological response of the upper and middle Huaihe River Basin (UMHRB) under future shared socioeconomic pathway scenarios (SSPs). The results show that the five-GCM ensemble improves the simulation accuracy compared to a single model. The climate over the UMHRB likely becomes warmer. The general trend of future precipitation is projected to increase, and the increased rates are higher in spring and winter than in summer and autumn. Changes in annual evapotranspiration are basically consistent with precipitation, but seasonal evapotranspiration shows different changes (0-18\%). The average annual runoff will increase in a wavelike manner, and the change patterns of runoff follow that of seasonal precipitation. Changes in soil moisture are not obvious, and the annual soil moisture increases slightly. In the intrayear process, soil moisture decreases slightly in autumn. The research results will enhance a more realistic understanding of the future hydrological response of the UMHRB and assist decision-makers in developing watershed flood risk-management measures and water and soil conservation plans.},

There are similarity and variation in streamflow regimes over the basin. The ratios of monthly maximum/minimum flows directly reflect discharge regimes. The ratios increase with drainage area from the headwaters to downstream within the Lena basin. This pattern is different from the nonpermafrost watersheds, and it clearly reflects permafrost effect on regional hydrological regime. There is a significant positive relationship between the ratio and basin permafrost coverage. This relationship indicates that permafrost condition does not significantly affect streamflow regime over the low permafrost (less than 40\%) regions, and it strongly affects discharge regime for regions with high permafrost (greater than 60\%). Temperature and precipitation have similar patterns among the subbasins. Basin precipitation has little association with permafrost conditions and an indirect relation with river flow regimes. There exists a good relation between the freezing index and permafrost extent over the basin, indicating that cold climate leads to high coverage of permafrost. This relation relates basin thermal condition with permafrost distribution. The combination of the relations between temperature versus permafrost extent, and permafrost extent versus flow ratio links temperature, permafrost, and flow regime over the Lena basin. Over the Aldan subbasin, the maximum/minimum discharge ratios significantly decrease during 1942-1998 due to increase in base flow; this change is consistent in general with permafrost degradation over eastern Siberia.},

But in other catchments, additional factors related to soil water storage change also have important controls on how precipitation seasonality propagates to streamflow. More importantly, use of leaf area index as a direct and indirect indicator of the above ground biomass and plant root system, respectively, reveals the vital role of vegetation in regulating soil moisture storage and hence streamflow intra-annual variability under different climate conditions.},

  abstract = {The waters of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers have always been a vital resource in the water-food-energy nexus of the Middle East region. The currently ongoing Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) in Turkey aims to increase regional prosperity by optimizing the use of these waters for irrigation and hydropower. Since the beginning of the 1990s, the irrigation schemes and water management infrastructures within the scope of the GAP have caused significant land use and land cover (LULC) change in this semi-arid region. We employed a high resolution regional climate model to simulate the effects of irrigation induced LULC changes on the regional water and energy balances. For this purpose, historical simulations were conducted by using three land cover distributions which reflect the increase in irrigation and water surfaces. Our experiment reveals that water loss through evapotranspiration increases significantly with the areal expansion of irrigation. This increase is driven by the change in partitioning of the available energy at the surface between turbulent heat fluxes. On the one hand, a significant reduction in sensible heat flux causes local cooling by around 0.4 {$^\circ$}C and 0.8 {$^\circ$}C for the current and future irrigation conditions, respectively. On the other hand, the increase in latent heat flux enhances evapotranspiration and consequently atmospheric water vapor concentration. The moistening of a shallower boundary layer triggers the formation of convective clouds, which increases convective precipitation, most notably during the irrigation months. The enhanced water loss through evapotranspiration has potential to significantly alter the water budget of the GAP region. It seems that the water surplus of the headwaters region may not be enough to meet the water deficit of the GAP region in the future if the planned irrigation schemes are carried out to completion.},

However, the physical mechanisms behind CDHWs and their impacts on socio-ecosystem productivity remain poorly understood. Here, using simulations from a large climate--hydrology model ensemble of 111 members, we demonstrate that the frequency of extreme CDHWs is projected to increase by tenfold globally under the highest emissions scenario, along with a disproportionate negative impact on vegetation and socio-economic productivity by the late twenty-first century. By combining satellite observations, field measurements and reanalysis, we show that terrestrial water storage and temperature are negatively coupled, probably driven by similar atmospheric conditions (for example, water vapour deficit and energy demand). Limits on water availability are likely to play a more important role in constraining the terrestrial carbon sink than temperature extremes, and over 90\% of the global population and gross domestic product could be exposed to increasing CDHW risks in the future, with more severe impacts in poorer and more rural areas. Our results provide crucial insights towards assessing and mitigating adverse effects of compound hazards on ecosystems and human well-being.},

However, a comprehensive global assessment for the partitioning of variability in P between E, Q and Delta S is still not available. In this study, we use the recently released global monthly hydrologic reanalysis product known as the Climate Data Record (CDR) to conduct an initial investigation of the inter-annual variability of the global terrestrial water cycle. We first examine global patterns in partitioning the long-term mean (P) over bar between the various sinks (E) over bar, (Q) over bar and (Delta S) over bar and confirm the well-known patterns with (P) over bar partitioned between (E) over bar and (Q) over bar according to the aridity index. In a new analysis based on the concept of variability source and sinks we then examine how variability in the precipitation sigma(2)(P) (the source) is partitioned between the three variability sinks sigma(2)(E), sigma(2)(Q) and sigma(2)(Delta S) along with the three relevant covariance terms, and how that partitioning varies with the aridity index. We find that the partitioning of inter-annual variability does not simply follow the mean state partitioning. Instead we find that sigma(2)(P) is mostly partitioned between sigma(2)(Q), sigma(2)(Delta S) and the associated covariances with limited partitioning to sigma(2)(E). We also find that the magnitude of the covariance components can be large and often negative, indicating that variability in the sinks (e.g. sigma(2)(Q), sigma(2)(Delta S) ) can, and regularly does, exceed variability in the source (sigma(2)(P)). Further investigations under extreme conditions revealed that in extremely dry environments the variance partitioning is closely related to the water storage capacity. With limited storage capacity the partitioning of sigma(2)(P) is mostly to sigma(2)(E), but as the storage capacity increases the partitioning of sigma(2)(P) is increasingly shared between sigma(2)(E), sigma(2)(Delta S) and the covariance between those variables. In other environments (i.e. extremely wet and semi-arid-semi-humid) the variance partitioning proved to be extremely complex and a synthesis has not been developed. We anticipate that a major scientific effort will be needed to develop a synthesis of hydrologic variability.},

Here we show that storm runoff extremes increase in most regions at rates higher than suggested by Clausius-Clapeyron scaling, which are systematically close to or exceed those of precipitation extremes over most regions of the globe, accompanied by large spatial and decadal variability. These results suggest that current projected response of storm runoff extremes to climate and anthropogenic changes may be underestimated, posing large threats for ecosystem and community resilience under future warming conditions.},

Combining surface hydrological data with modeling and satellite data from 2002 to 2016 CE, our study reveals that an enormous amount of water, similar to 54 +/- 4 km(3), is unaccounted for annually in the Qiangtang Basin. The amount of missing water is comparable to the total annual discharge of the Yellow River. Data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission show little increase of local terrestrial water storage. Thus, the missing water must have flowed out of the basin through underground passages. Interpreting this result in the context of recent seismic and geological studies of Tibet, we suggest that a significant amount of meteoric water in the Qiangtang Basin leaks out by way of groundwater flow through deep normal faults and tensional fractures along the nearly north-south rift valleys that are oriented subnormal to and cross the surficial hydrological divide on the southern margin of the basin. Cross-basin groundwater outflow of such a magnitude defies the traditional view of a basin-scale water cycle and leads to a very different picture from the previous hydrological view of the Qiangtang Basin. This finding calls for major rethinking of the regional water balance.},

We present a novel framework for calibrating GHMs assuming that parameters can be regionalized by climate similarities. We calibrated four sensitive parameters of the H08 global hydrological model by aggregating the results of 5,000 simulations with randomly generated parameters into 11 Koppen climate classes and using an objective function Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) with random sampling from the proposed parameter distribution. From a 100-fold split-sampling test, we found that both the representativeness and robustness of the transferred parameter sets were guaranteed when the upper 5\% of the samples were accepted and assign the median of each accepted parameter distribution for the climate class. The simulation with the climate-based parameters yielded satisfactory (NSE {$>$} 0.0) and good (NSE {$>$} 0.5) performances at 480 and 234 stations (61.7\% and 30.1\% of 777 stations), respectively. The storage capacity (SD) and the conductive coefficient (C-D) were sensitive to the climate classes and exhibited well-constrained distributions of the accepted samples, whereas the recession parameters for the subsurface storage (gamma and tau) showed little or no explanatory power to climate. The identified parameters for climate classes exhibited consistency with the physical interpretation of soil formation and efficiencies in vapor transfer. The consistency of the identified parameter values with physical underpinnings indicates that the appropriate parameters were determined, which ensured the robustness of parameters, especially when they are transferred to ungauged watersheds.},

This review first summarizes recent observed changes of snow cover over the TP, including the relationship between the TP snow cover and that over Eurasia as a whole; recent climatology and spatial patterns; inter-annual variability and trends; as well as projected changes in snow cover. Second, we discuss the physical causes and factors contributing to variations in snow cover over the TP, including precipitation, temperature, and synoptic forcing such as the Arctic Oscillation and the westerly jet, and large scale ocean-atmosphere oscillations such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ESNO), the Indian Ocean dipole, and the southern annular mode. Third, linkage between snow cover over the TP and subsequent weather and climate systems are discussed, including the East and South Asian Summer Monsoons, and their subsequent precipitation regimes. Finally, new perspectives and unresolved issues are outlined, including changes in extreme events and related disasters (e.g., avalanches), the use of novel datasets, the possible elevation dependency in snow cover change, expected snow cover changes under 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C global warming, the physical mechanisms modulating climate extremes in the region, and the linkage between snow cover variation and atmospheric pollution. Despite a large body of work over the TP, we argue that there is a need for more comparative studies using multiple snow datasets, and snow cover information over the western TP and during summer would benefit from more attention in the future.},

  abstract = {全球增温背景下,区域与全球水文循环变化特征和机理是水文学界研究的重点与难点。径流是水文循环过程最基本的环节,其变化受气候和流域特征综合影响。受限于观测径流数据的站点数量与空间覆盖度,当前径流变化检测及归因研究主要集中于区域尺度,全球观测径流变化归因研究亟待开展。Budyko假设阐述了流域水分与能量供应的关系,因其理论基础坚实,物理意义明确,现广泛运用于年/多年尺度径流模拟与归因研究中。本文通过整合中国各个流域的观测径流数据以及新近的全球观测径流数据集,基于Budyko水热耦合平衡方程,定量评估全球观测径流长时间尺度平均变化的成因;融合Budyko水热耦合平衡方程及趋势检验方法,提出考虑融雪影响的径流变化趋势定量归因框架,探讨全球不同纬度带的径流趋势变化成因;提取全球流域尺度气象与流域特征数据,构建针对全球不同气候区的Budyko水热耦合平衡方程流域特征参数经验模型,并结合CMIP6气候模式数据,预估未来气候情景下全球径流变化及其成因。研究结果表明:(1)1960～2014年,全球观测径流变化的主导因子为流域特征变化(涵盖流域下垫面变化及人类活动等影响,即Budyko流域特征参数n),而全球模拟径流变化的主导因子为降水变化。本文模拟径流变化主导因子与前人基于模拟径流数据得到的全球归因研究结果基本一致,而与观测径流归因结果不同。在全球尺度的径流归因研究中,使用观测径流数据可得到更加可信度的结果。(2)考虑融雪影响的径流变化趋势定量归因框架的对于径流变化趋势的模拟效果良好,且在中高纬度地区的模拟效果明显优于不考虑融雪的径流变化趋势归因框架,决定系数由0.66上升为0.71。在全球尺度,各因子主导径流趋势变化的站点数量占比分别为降雨变化(48.8\%)、流域特征变化(45.7\%)、潜在蒸散发变化(2.8\%)、融雪变化(2.7\%)。(3)构建的Budyko水热耦合平衡方程流域特征参数经验模型,在栅格尺度的多年平均径流以及蒸散发模拟中均具有良好的模拟效果,其决定系数分别达到0.92及0.85。基于CMIP6气候模式数据的结果表明,在2021～2100年,降水变化为全球径流变化的主导因子,而在2021～2040年,部分温带区域的径流变化由流域特征变化控制。本文系统研究了全球观测径流的变化规律及成因,拓展了水热耦合平衡方程中控制参数的物理意义,并基于此发展了针对不同气候区的控制参数经验模型。研究有助于推进径流模拟与归因研究的发展、增进对全球径流演变的理解,可为区域及全球水资源规划管理提供理论参考。},

  abstract = {Climate variability and human activity were regarded as two contributors to streamflow alteration. However, the contributions of the two factors were still unclear in Dongting Lake. Therefore, it was crucial to quantify the relative impact of climate variability and human activity on streamflow alteration. The time series (1961-2010) was divided into three periods, namely, natural period (1961-1980), change period I (1981-2002) and change period II (2003-2010). Sensitivity analysis based on Budyko-type equations was applied to reveal the contributions of climate variability and human activity in those two change periods, respectively. The results showed that during the change period I, climate variability was the main factor responsible for streamflow alteration in most parts of Dongting Lake, accounting for 60.07-67.27\%. However, the impact of climate variability was slightly smaller than that of human activity in West Dongting Lake (the former accounting for 43.20\% while the latter accounting for 56.80\%). For the change period II, human activity was the dominate factor for streamflow alteration, accounting for 58.89-78.33\%. The impact of climate variability gradually decreased while the impact of human activity gradually increased. Along with the intensification of the human activity, the impact of it became more dominant. The results could provide a reference for water resources planning and management decisions. Under the condition of uncontrollable climatic factor, effective measures should be put forward in controlling human activity, such as reservoir/dam operation, closed management of protected area and so on. Besides, it is essential to study the impact of climate variability on future water resources and water resource management under different climate change scenarios.

However, the power of these tests has not been well documented. This study investigates the power of the tests by Monte Carlo simulation. Simulation results indicate that their power depends on the pre-assigned significance level. magnitude of trend. sample size. and the amount of variation within a time series. That is. the bigger the absolute magnitude of trend. the more powerful are the tests, as the sample size increases, the tests become more powerful: and as the amount of variation increases within a time series. the power of the tests decrease. When a trend is present. the power is also dependent on the distribution type and skewness of the time series. The simulation results also demonstrate that these two tests have similar power in detecting a trend, to the point of being indistinguishable in practice. The two tests are implemented to assess the significance of trends in annual maximum daily streamflow data of 20 pristine basins in Ontario, Canada. Results indicate that the P-values computed by these different tests are almost identical. By the binomial distribution. the field significant downward trend was assessed at the significance level of 0.05, Results indicate that a higher number of sites show evidence of decreasing trends than one might expect due to chance alone.

  abstract = {在全球气候变化不断加剧的背景下,全球水循环发生了显著变化,引发了一系列资源、灾害、环境问题。长江流域是我国重要的水源地,其水循环和水资源的变化对中国社会经济发展影响重大。然而,关于该流域未来水资源的演变趋势,目前研究成果未达成共识。因此,本文以长江流域为研究区,综合运用地理学、气候学、水文学等多学科方法,借助全球气候模式、土地利用模拟模型、水文模型等,系统地开展了``气候及径流的演变特征---气候情景预估---径流变化预测---旱涝变化预估''研究,以期为全球变化下长江流域水资源的适应性管理以及旱涝灾害防控等提供决策支持。首先,利用气象驱动数据和径流观测数据,分析长江流域气候及径流的演变特征。其次,基于第六次国际耦合模式比较计划(CMIP6)的全球气候模式(GCMs)数据,评估三种SSP-RCP(SSP1-2.6、SSP2-4.5、SSP5-8.5)情景下长江流域降水与气温的变化。再次,通过耦合GCMs、未来土地利用模拟模型(FLUS)以及水土评估工具(SWAT),对气候变化和土地利用变化共同影响下的长江流域21世纪中期(2045-2064年)逐月径流进行预测,并从平均径流和极端径流两个方面,分析其相较于基准期(1995-2014年)的变化。最后,探讨了长江流域21世纪中期水文干旱和洪涝灾害风险的变化趋势。主要研究工作和结论如下:(1)采用TFPW-MK趋势检验法、Pettitt's Test突变检测法以及EEMD集合经验模态分解方法,系统地阐明了长江流域气候及径流的演变特征。1960-2014年,长江流域整体上年降水量和年均日最高气温未发生显著变化,而年均日最低气温以0.11{\textcelsius}/10a的速率显著上升。研究区8个水文站的年径流趋势检测结果表明,仅万县水文站、宜昌水文站的年径流发生显著变化,变化速率分别为-8.93{\texttimes}10{\textasciitilde}8m{\textasciitilde}3/a和-7.44{\texttimes}10{\textasciitilde}8m{\textasciitilde}3/a。季节径流趋势检测结果表明,8个水文站春、夏季径流多表现为不显著的趋势变化,秋季径流以显著减少趋势为主,而冬季径流均为显著增多趋势。Pettitt's Test年径流突变检验结果显示,除万县水文站以外,其他站点均未发生显著的模式改变,这一结果为后续水文模型模拟的可行性奠定了基础。EEMD分解结果表明,年际振荡在长江流域径流长期变化中处于主导地位。(2)选用CMIP6中的23个GCMs,评估了SSP-RCP情景下长江流域降水与气温的变化。气候模式性能评估结果表明,经验分位数映射法能够有效校正气候模式中的偏差,校正后各气候模式的模拟性能均得到了大幅度的提高,并且多模式集合平均的模拟性能优于任意单个气候模式。继而基于23个模式的集合平均,评估了长江流域降水与气温的变化。结果表明,2025-2100年长江流域降水量、日最高气温以及日最低气温均表现为显著增加(升高)趋势,并且随着排放浓度的增加,其增加(升高)的速率越大;相同情景下日最高气温的升温速率预计高于日最低气温的升温速率。到21世纪末期(2081-2100年),不同情景下长江流域降水量预计较基准期分别增加10.41\%(SSP1-2.6)、10.66\%(SSP2-4.5)和15.80\%(SSP5-8.5);日最高气温(日最低气温)预计分别升高1.75(1.50){\textcelsius}(SSP1-2.6)、2.72(2.54){\textcelsius}(SSP2-4.5)和5.04(4.85){\textcelsius}(SSP5-8.5)。(3)通过耦合GCMs,FLUS模型和SWAT模型,预测了气候变化和土地利用变化共同影响下的长江流域径流变化。利用多指标(决定系数、纳什系数、偏差百分比等),从月尺度上评价了SWAT模型的性能,证明了本文构建的SWAT模型能够用于长江流域径流预测。利用GCMs校正结果驱动SWAT模型,对长江流域基准期逐月径流进行模拟,优选出了模拟精度较高的8个GCMs。基于FLUS模型模拟了长江流域2020年土地利用分布,其精度评价结果表明该模型能够用于长江流域土地利用模拟,继而基于该模型预测了三种SSP-RCP情景下的长江流域2050年土地利用分布。在此基础上,对长江流域21世纪中期径流变化进行预测。结果表明:相较于基准期,不同SSP-RCP情景下长江流域8个水文站的年均径流都将增加,而各月径流量的变化方向不尽相同;月径流占比变幅最大的月份均集中在6-10月,并以6-7月径流占比减小,8-10月径流占比增加为主;各水文站Q95丰水极值径流均有所增加;Q5枯水极值径流的变化方向在情景之间以及站点之间有所不同。SSP1-2.6情景下,各水文站的Q5枯水极值径流均将增加;SSP2-4.5和SSP5-8.5情景下,上游水文站Q5枯水极值径流以减少为主,而中下游水文站Q5枯水极值径流均较基准期增加。(4)从标准化径流指数(SRI)的变化趋势、干旱特征、干旱频率三个方面,全面地评估了21世纪中期长江流域水文干旱的变化情况。SRI指数趋势检测结果表明,三种SSP-RCP情景下,21世纪中期长江流域季节尺度、年尺度SRI指数均以不显著变湿润趋势为主。基于游程理论的干旱事件识别结果显示,21世纪中期长江流域整体上干旱历时(严重程度)较基准期有所减少(降低),且均以SSP5-8.5情景减少(降低)幅度最大,其次是SSP1-2.6情景,而SSP2-4.5情景最小;不同情景下干旱强度均较基准期略微升高;干旱最长历时均较基准期有所减少且在SSP2-4.5和SSP5-8.5情景降幅较大;最大严重程度在SSP1-2.6情景下较基准期略微升高,而在另外两种情景下大幅降低。就干旱频率而言,不同情景下长江流域未来干旱频率均较基准期略有升高,且升高幅度随着温室气体浓度的增加而加大。(5)构建了长江流域洪涝灾害风险评估模型,继而评估了21世纪中期长江流域洪涝灾害风险相较于基准期的变化。结果表明,不同情景下长江流域大部分地区的洪涝灾害风险指数均将较基准期有所升高,以湖北孝感,四川内江、甘孜稻城县以及凉山木里藏族自治县等地尤为突出。高风险区和较高风险区将在基准期的基础上向外扩张。SSP2-4.5情景下高风险区的面积增幅最大,达到35.16\%。较高风险区的增幅将随着温室气体排放浓度的增加而加大。以上结果预示着21世纪中期长江流域洪涝灾害风险加大,对于危险区域务必要做好相关防御准备工作,同时对于风险指数升高幅度大的区域也要给予更多关注。},

This study applies a variance decomposition framework to assessing ET interannual and intra-annual variance in 32 large river basins. It is found that climate (precipitation and potential ET) and terrestrial storage play different roles in ET variance with different time scales. At the interannual scale, ET variance is primarily controlled by climatic variability and dampened/enhanced by terrestrial storage change. At the intra-annual scale, the sources of ET variance exhibit a geographic pattern: ET variance is controlled by terrestrial storage change in Middle Asia, by seasonality in the Indian monsoon region, by precipitation and terrestrial storage in low altitude arid regions, and by potential ET and terrestrial storage in boreal regions. Quantifying the components of ET variability will help scientists understand the factors on ET processes under various natural and anthropogenic conditions.},

This paper presents an integrated method employing the Budyko-based Fu model, hydrological modeling, and climate elasticity approaches to separate the effects of the two driving factors on surface runoff in the Luan River basin, China. The Budyko-based Fu model and the double mass curve method are used to analyze runoff changes during the period 1958 similar to 2009. Then two types of hydrological models (the distributed Soil and Water Assessment Tool model and the lumped SIMHYD model) and seven climate elasticity methods (including a nonparametric method and six Budyko-based methods) are applied to estimate the contributions of climate change and human activities to runoff change. The results show that all quantification methods are effective, and the results obtained by the nine methods are generally consistent. During the study period, the effects of climate change on runoff change accounted for 28.3 similar to 46.8\% while those of human activities contributed with 53.2 similar to 71.7\%, indicating that both factors have significant effects on the runoff decline in the basin, and that the effects of human activities are relatively stronger than those of climate change.},

The bias, absolute error and correlation coefficient are used to quantify water balance performances at monthly and annual time steps. The results show that the absolute error in the YRB water balance was 18.1 mm/month and 152.5 mm/yr at monthly and annual time steps accounting for 20\% and 14\% of YRB precipitation, respectively. The three satellite products were combined through a water balance equation to estimate monthly and annual stream flow, which was in error by 19.4 mm/month and 76.7 mm/yr, accounting for 22\% and 7\% of YRB precipitation, respectively. Trends in YRB water balance components at annual time steps obtained from satellite products were in the range 83--318\% of the corresponding trends from alternative datasets (e.g., ground-based measurements, land-surface modelling, etc.), which performed significantly better than monthly time series. The results indicate that the YRB water balance can be evaluated using multiple satellite products to a reasonable accuracy at annual time steps.},

A hydrologic modeling framework was established across the TP to link the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land surface hydrology model with a degree-day glacier-melt scheme (VIC-glacier model) at a 1/12 degrees x1/12 degrees. The model performance was evaluated over the upper basins of the six rivers. The heterogeneity and scarcity of the meteorological stations are the major limitation for hydrological modeling over the TP. The relative contributions to streamflow from rainfall, snowmelt, and glacier melt for the six basins were quantified via the model framework and simulation. The results suggest that monsoon precipitation has a dominant role in sustaining seasonal streamflow over southeastern regions, contributing 65-78\% of annual runoff among the UYE, UYA, UM, US, and UB basins. For the UI, the runoff regime is largely controlled by the glacier melt and snow cover in spring and summer. The contribution of glacier runoff is minor for the UYE and UM (less than 2\% of total annual flow), and moderate for the UYA and US basins (5-7\% of yearly flow), while glacier melt makes up about 12\% and 48\% of annual flow for the UB and UI basins, respectively.},

Such a switch in the state of precipitation not only alters temporal distribution of intra-annual runoff but also tends to yield less total annual runoff. Long-term water balance for 282 catchments across China is investigated, showing that a decreasing snow ratio reduces annual runoff for a given total precipitation. Within the Budyko framework, we develop an equation to quantify the relationship between snow ratio and annual runoff from a water-energy balance viewpoint. Based on the proposed equation, attribution of runoff change during the past several decades and possible runoff change induced by projected snow ratio change using climate experiment outputs archived in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are analyzed. Results indicate that annual runoff in northwestern mountainous and northern high-latitude areas are sensitive to snow ratio change. The proposed model is applicable to other catchments easily and quantitatively for analyzing the effects of possible change in snow ratio on available water resources and evaluating the vulnerability of catchments to climate change.},

  abstract = {Variations in streamflows of five tributaries of the Poyang Lake basin, China, because of the influence of human activities and climate change were evaluated using the Australia Water Balance Model and multivariate regression. Results indicated that multiple regression models were appropriate with precipitation, potential evapotranspiration of the current month, and precipitation of the last month as explanatory variables. The NASH coefficient for the Australia Water Balance Model was larger than 0.842, indicating satisfactory simulation of streamflow of the Poyang Lake basin. Comparison indicated that the sensitivity method could not exclude the benchmark-period human influence, and the human influence on streamflow changes was overestimated. Generally, contributions of human activities and climate change to streamflow changes were 73.2\% and 26.8\% respectively. However, human-induced and climate-induced influences on streamflow were different in different river basins. Specifically, climate change was found to be the major driving factor for the increase of streamflow within the Rao, Xin, and Gan River basins; however, human activity was the principal driving factor for the increase of streamflow of the Xiu River basin and also for the decrease of streamflow of the Fu River basin. Meanwhile, impacts of human activities and climate change on streamflow variations were distinctly different at different temporal scales. At the annual time scale, the increase of streamflow was largely because of climate change and human activities during the 1970s-1990s and the decrease of streamflow during the 2000s. At the seasonal scale, climate change was the main factor behind the increase of streamflow in the spring and summer season. Human activities increase the streamflow in autumn and winter, but decrease the streamflow in spring. At the monthly scale, different influences of climate change and human activities were detected. Climate change was the main factor behind the decrease of streamflow during May to June and human activities behind the decrease of streamflow during February to May. Results of this study can provide a theoretical basis for basin-scale water resources management under the influence of climate change and human activities.

We found 99 new lakes and extensive lake expansion on the Tibetan Plateau during the last four decades, 1970-2013, due to increased precipitation and cryospheric contributions to its water balance. This contrasts with disappearing lakes and drastic shrinkage of lake areas on the adjacent Mongolian Plateau: 208 lakes disappeared, and 75\% of the remaining lakes have shrunk. We detected a statistically significant coincidental timing of lake area changes in both plateaus, associated with the climate regime shift that occurred during 1997/1998. This distinct change in 1997/1998 is thought to be driven by large-scale atmospheric circulation changes in response to climate warming. Our findings reveal that these two adjacent plateaus have been changing in opposite directions in response to climate change. These findings shed light on the complex role of the regional climate and water cycles and provide useful information for ecological and water resource planning in these fragile landscapes.},

However, hydroclimatic drivers of GRACE-derived TWSC in different climates have not been systematically examined, which hinders its applications in water resources management and hydrological model development. In this study, we derived the monthly TWSC using the GRACE dataset, and analyzed its partial correlations with precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), runoff (R), and temperature (T) from 2003 to 2019 under the Ko center dot ppen-Geiger world climate classification system. Relative contributions of the four hydroclimatic elements (P, ET, R, and T) to TWSC were quantified using the hierarchical partitioning method. The results indicate that P mainly controls TWSC in tropical climates, hot semi-arid climate, and temperate and continental climates with dry winter. ET is the primary driver of TWSC in mid-and high -latitude regions that feature temperate and continental climates with no dry season, subarctic climates, and polar climates. T mainly influences TWSC in cold arid climates, temperate and continental climates with dry summer or no dry season, and ice cap climate. However, TWSC in many arid climates near the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn are not well explained by all four hydroclimatic variables according to their non-significant partial correlations. Large trends in annual TWSC are found in South America, western Canada, eastern contiguous United States, and Africa, which are likely due to marked changes in P based on their similar spatial pattern. In particular, decreasing TWSC are found in most continental climates, which manifests a deterioration of water resources availability in these regions. Overall, our results clarify the major hydroclimatic drivers of TWSC in different climates at a global scale, which may help improve TWSC modeling and prediction through a judicious selection of explanatory hydroclimatic variables in different climates.},

  abstract = {Rainfall can potentially change upper thermal-moisture boundary conditions and influence the hydrological and thermal state of the active layer in permafrost regions. Studying the relationship between rainfall and ground temperature represents an emerging issue in permafrost engineering and environment but the interactive mechanisms of rainfall and the active layer are not well understood. This study aims to analyze the effects and mechanisms of summertime rainfall on the thermal-moisture dynamics of the active layer by field observations and simulation. The observation data demonstrated that frequent light rainfall events had a minor impact on the active layer, whereas consecutive rainfall events and heavy rainfall events had significant effects on soil temperature and water content. Moreover, the soil temperatures were more susceptible to summertime rainfall events. These rapidly cooled the shallow ground and delayed the temperature rise. Summertime rainfall significantly increased the surface latent heat flux, but decreased the net radiation, sensible heat flux, and soil surface heat flux. Rainfall also enhanced the amount of downward liquid water and water vapor, but the impact of rainfall on the increase in the convective heat transfer of the liquid water was lower than the decreases in the heat conduction flux, latent heat flux by vapor diffusion, and heat flux by convection of vapor. Thus, the reduction in the total soil heat flux caused by rainfall directly leads to a cooling effect on the soil temperature and delays the increase in soil temperature. The cooling effect of rainfall events may mitigate the warming rate and maintain the active layer at a relatively low temperature. The results provide new insights into understanding the inner mechanisms of the effect of rainfall on the active layer and on the possible long-term change trends of permafrost under increasing precipitation in the central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

  abstract = {Hydrological processes in high altitude mountainous regions differ from those in more temperate regions, primarily due to such influences as cold temperatures, large and rapid change in surface energy balance during snowmelt, a long period at low-temperature environmental condition and the existence of permafrost. A physically based, semi-distributed water balance model to quantitatively simulate the hydrological processes and stream flow, as well as to estimate the potential consequences of projected global warming on stream flow for such high altitude mountainous regions was constructed. Distributed meteorological data from the interpolation of the point measurements by means of a digital elevation model (DEM) of the basin, such as air temperature, precipitation, snowfall ratio, wind speed, etc., have been used as model input. Several other hydrological parameters, such as soil moisture content and evapotranspiration, which are essential in simulation of river runoff in a water balance state, were estimated by the combination of Landsat TM and a DEM with the utilization of the distributed meteorological data. The model uses only a few crucial parameters for calibration, and the model structure is based upon estimating the stream flow components. Simulated results of spatially distributed soil moisture content, evapotranspiration and monthly discharge yield reasonable agreement, both spatially and temporally, to the field observations or the estimated results by the other approaches. This physically based model has the potential to project stream flow under the possible climate scenarios. Copyright {\copyright} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Agricultural drought (AD) is disastrous to crop production and plant growth. The prediction of AD with sufficient lead time is helpful for developing agricultural water strategy, particularly under the context of global warming. However, the previous studies mainly focused on short lead times (1-6 months) and only used 3 or less variables to predict AD through copula models. In this study, a novel multivariate time series convolutional neural network (T-CNN) is developed to predict AD with long lead times based on multiple meteorological variables. To demonstrate its feasibility and novelty, T-CNN is used in the Aral Sea Basin (ASB) where agricultural production is dominant. Three global climate models (GCMs) and three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) from CMIP6 are considered during 2026-2100. Results indicate that (1) precipitation, temperature, potential evapotranspiration, relative humidity and northward wind are significantly correlated with AD, and are selected as the predictors of AD; (2) compared with the conventional CNN and convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM), T-CNN's performance is better, taking only about 10\% of the computation time of ConvLSTM; (3) T-CNN can effectively extract the spatiotemporal characteristics of meteorological predictors and reproduce AD, showing high correlation coefficients (R{$>$}0.9) for 92.5\% of the grids across ASB; (4) the result of simple model averaging (SMA) is better than other GCMs, indicating that the spatial differences in AD would become more pronounced with increasing time and emission level; (5) compared with the historical period, under SSP585, the extreme drought would increase 0.20 months/year (2026-2050), 0.23 months/year (2051-2075) and 0.28 months/year (2076-2100). The results highlight the spatiotemporal variation of AD in 21st century with a high resolution (0.1 degrees x0.1 degrees), which can provide scientific support for agricultural water management and long-term drought prevention in ASB.},

This study establishes a relationship between the change in the landscape parameter in a Budyko equation and vegetation change (represented by fPAR, the fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by vegetation) for catchments in China, where, due to large-scale soil and water conservation projects implemented by the Chinese government, vegetation and regional hydrology have changed substantially over the past 30years. The ratio of landscape parameter change to the change in fPAR has a strong relationship with the aridity index, and thus, vegetation change can be converted into a change in the landscape parameter. Then, the fPAR elasticity of runoff is introduced and formulated under the Budyko framework. It provides a useful tool for the quantitative evaluation of the regional hydrological response to vegetation change, but the proposed relationship still needs to be evaluated in other catchments around the globe where large-scale afforestation or vegetation recovery has occurred.},

Study focus: The main objective is to evaluate the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities to the water and sediment resources of the studied region in 1960-2015. The variation of runoff and suspended sediment load is first analyzed with regard to their trends and abrupt change. Different factors attributable to the variation are then quantitatively separated. New hydrological insights for the region: The annual runoff and sediment load across the MLJRB both decreased abruptly and coincidently in the recent two decades, with the transitional years detected to be 2006 and 2002, respectively. Comparing the post-transition period to the pre-transition period, runoff decreased 14.7\% and sediment load decreased 63\%. Climate change is the major contribution for the decrease in runoff, which explains 56.3\% of the reduction, and impoundment of large reservoirs and water consumption contributed 18.6\% and 2.7\% respectively. The other 22.5\% was ascribed to water-soil conservation and other factors. In contrast to water resources, human activities were dominant in sediment reduction, including 44.9\% caused by large reservoirs, 1\% from increased water consumption and 35\% by conservation measures and other potential factors. Remarkably, almost 90\% of the sediment load can be trapped as the direct consequence of the construction and operation of two huge dams, Xiluodu and Xiangjiaba, since 2013.},

However, whether and to what extent the enhanced extreme precipitation translates into changes in river floods remains controversial. Here we demonstrate that previously reported unapparent or even negative responses of river flood discharge (defined as annual maximum discharge) to extreme precipitation increases are largely caused by mixing the signals of floods with different generating mechanisms. Stratifying by flood type, we show a positive response of rainstorm-induced floods to extreme precipitation increases. However, this response is almost entirely offset by concurrent decreases in snow-related floods, leading to an overall unapparent change in total global floods in both historical observations and future climate projections. Our findings highlight an increasing rainstorm-induced flood risk under warming and the importance of distinguishing flood-generating mechanisms in assessing flood changes and associated social-economic and environmental risks.},

Thus land use management and rehabilitation strategies will have an impact on catchment water balance and hence water yield and groundwater recharge. The key controls on evapotranspiration are rainfall interception, net radiation, advection, turbulent transport, leaf area, and plant-available water capacity. The relative importance of these factors depends on climate, soil, and vegetation conditions. Results from over 250 catchments worldwide show that for a given forest cover, there is a good relationship between long-term average evapotranspiration and rainfall. From these observations and on the basis of previous theoretical work a simple two-parameter model was developed that relates mean annual evapotranspiration to rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, and plant-available water capacity. The mean absolute error between modeled and measured evapotranspiration was 42 mm or 6.0\%; the least squares line through the origin had a slope of 1.00 and a correlation coefficient of 0.96. The model showed potential for a variety of applications including water yield modeling and recharge estimation. The model is a practical tool that can be readily used for assessing the long-term average effect of vegetation changes on catchment evapotranspiration and is scientifically justifiable.},

Results indicate that: (1) glacier-melt runoff exhibits a significant increase in both areas by the Mann--Kendall test. Snowmelt runoff shows an increasing trend in the UM, while the US is characterized by a decreasing tendency. In the UM, the snowmelt runoff peak shifts from June in the baseline period 1964--1990 to May for both the 1990s and 2000s; (2) rainfall runoff was considered as the first dominant factor driving changes of river discharge, which could be responsible for over 84\% in total runoff trend over the two regions. The glacial runoff illustrates the secondary influence on the total runoff tendency; (3) although the hydrological regime is rain dominated in these two basins, the glacier compensation effect in these regions is obvious, especially in dry years.},

  abstract = {Climate change will likely increase the total streamflow in most headwaters on the Tibetan Plateau in the next decades, yet the response of runoff components to climate change and permafrost thaw remain largely uncertain. Here, we investigate the changes in runoff components under a changing climate, based on a high-resolution cryosphere-hydrology model (Spatial Processes in Hydrology model, SPHY) and multi-decadal streamflow observations at the upstream (Jimai) and downstream stations (Maqu and Tangnaihai) in the source-region of the Yellow River (SYR). We find that rainfall flow dominates the runoff regime in SYR (contributions of 48\%-56\%), followed by snowmelt flow (contributions of 26\%/23\% at Maqu/Tangnaihai). Baseflow is more important at Jimai (32\%) than at the the downstream stations (21\%-23\%). Glacier meltwater from the Anye Maqen and Bayankala Mountains contributes negligibly to the downstream total runoff. With increasing temperature and precipitation, the increase in total runoff is smaller in the warm and wet downstream stations than in the cold and dry upstream station. This is because of a higher increase in evapotranspiration and a larger reduction in snowmelt flow in the downstream region in response to a warming climate. With temperature increase, there is less increase in rainfall flow in the downstream region due to increased water loss through evapotranspiration. Meanwhile, the decline in snowmelt flow is larger further downstream, which can negatively impact the spring irrigation for the whole Yellow River basin that supports the livelihoods of 140 million people. Importantly, we find that baseflow plays an increasingly important role in the permafrost-dominated upstream region with atmospheric warming and permafrost thaw, accompanied by decreased surface flow. These findings improve our current understanding of how different hydrological processes respond to climate change and provide insights for optimizing hydropower and irrigation systems in the entire Yellow River basin under a rapidly changing climate.},

The spatial patterns show an overall lake growth in the north of the inner plateau against a reduction in the south, which are accompanied by most of the lakes cooling in the north against warming in the south, and longer ice cover duration in the north compared with the south. The changes in lake temperature are negatively correlated with water level variations and lake ice duration. Enhanced precipitation is the dominant contributor to increased lake water storage, followed by glacier mass loss and permafrost thawing. The decadal or longer lake expansion since the mid-1990s could have been driven by the positive phase of Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, and clear inflection points of lake area/level identified in 1997/1998 and 2015/2016 are attributed to strong El Nino events. In the near-term, the lakes will continue to expand. Future interdisciplinary lake studies are urgently required to improve understanding of climate-cryosphere-hydrosphere interactions and water resources management.},

  abstract = {The global land monsoon region, with substantial monsoon rainfall and hence freshwater resources, is home to nearly two-thirds of the world's population. However, it is overwhelmed by extreme precipitation, which is more intense than that on the rest of the land. Whether extreme precipitation has changed significantly, particularly in association with global warming, remains unclear for this region. This study investigates the presence of monotonic trends in extreme precipitation and its association with global warming over the past century over the global land monsoon regions, by employing the most comprehensive, long-running, and high-quality observational extreme precipitation records currently available. Based on a total of 5066 stations with at least 50 years of records, we found significant increases in the annual maximum daily precipitation and associations with global warming in regional monsoon domains, including the southern part of the South African monsoon region, the South Asian monsoon region (dominated by India), the North American monsoon region, and the eastern part of the South American monsoon region during the period of 1901--2010, with responses to global warming of {\textasciitilde}10.4\%--14.2\% K-1, 7.9\%--8.3\% K-1, 6.4\%--10.8\% K-1, and 15.1\%--24.8\% K-1, respectively. For the global monsoon region as a whole, significant increases in extreme precipitation and associations with global warming are also identified, but with limited spatial coverage. The qualitative results on the significance of the changes on the regional scale are generally robust against different time periods, record lengths of stations, and datasets used. The uncertainty in the quantitative results arising from limited spatial and temporal coverages and use of different datasets deserves attention.},

  abstract = {Climate and landuse change impact the hydrologic cycle resulting in changes in catchment water yield and streamflow characteristics. Understanding the combined effect of climate and landuse change on water is essential for developing sustainable water resources plans. Most studies consider only the isolated effect of climate alone or landuse alone, and this could skew the picture of hydrologic responses by attributing too little or too much importance to climate or landuse change. Quantifying the combined impact of climate and landuse change is a significant challenge as water yield is the convolution of both these factors. This paper briefly reviews key literature on quantifying climate and landuse change impacts on water yield with an emphasis on the framework developed over the last decade. We discuss the assumptions embedded in the framework and the potential for predicting climate and landuse impact on future water yield.},

  abstract = {Partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration and runoff is controlled by climate and catchment characteristics. The degree of control exerted by these factors varies with the spatial and temporal scales of processes modeled. The Budyko framework or the "Limits" concept was used to model water balance at four temporal scales (mean annual, annual, monthly and daily). The method represents a top-down approach to hydrologic modeling and is expected to achieve parsimony of model parameters. Daily precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and streamflow from 265 catchments in Australia were used. On a mean annual basis, the index of dryness defined as the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation was confirmed to be a dominant factor in determining the water balance with one model parameter. Analysis of the data, however, suggested increased model complexity is necessary on finer time scale such as monthly. In response, the Budyko framework for mean annual water balance was extended to include additional factors and this resulted in a parsimonious lumped conceptual model on shorter-time scale. The model was calibrated and tested against measured streamflow at variable time scales and showed promising results. The strengths of the model are consistent water balance relationships across different time scales, and model parsimony and robustness. As result, the model. has the potential to be used to predict streamflow for ungauged catchments. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here, precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (E), soil moisture (SM), and runoff (R) from 25 CMIP6 models, together with self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index with Penman-Monteith potential evapotranspiration (scPDSIpm), are analyzed to quantify hydroclimatic and drought changes in the twenty-first century and the underlying causes. Results confirm consistent drying in these hydroclimatic metrics across most of the Americas (including the Amazon), Europe and the Mediterranean region, southern Africa, and Australia, although the drying magnitude differs, with the drying being more severe and widespread in surface SM than in total SM. Global drought frequency based on surface SM and scPDSIpm increases by similar to 25\%-100\% (50\%-200\%) under the SSP2-4.5 (SSP5-8.5) scenario in the twenty-first century together with large increases in drought duration and areas, which result from a decrease in the mean and flattening of the probability distribution functions of SM and scPDSIpm, while the R-based drought changes are relatively small. Changes in both P and E contribute to the SM change, whereas scPDSIpm decreases result from ubiquitous PET increases and P decreases over subtropical areas. The R changes are determined primarily by P changes, while the PET change explains most of the E increase. Intermodel spreads in surface SM and R changes are large, leading to large uncertainties in the drought projections.},

The oscillation suggests that the MLYRB will experience increased runoff in the next few decades after 2020, which saw a record high runoff in the MLYRB. The decadal changes in summer runoff over the MLYRB under various climate change scenarios are then analyzed with direct runoff outputs from 28 general circulation models participating in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Given that the equal-weighted multi-model ensemble mean could not well represent the historical runoff changes in the MLYRB, in this paper we introduce a model weighting scheme that considers both the model skill and independence. It turns out that this scheme well constrains the models to represent the observed decadal changes of summer runoff. The weighted mean projections suggest that the summer runoff in the MLYRB during 2015-2100 under all warming scenarios will be higher than the present day; and 2021-2040 is likely to be a period with significantly increased summer runoff. Results of the present study have great implications for flood control and effective water resources management over the MLYRB in the future, and the weighting approach used in this paper can be applied to a wide range of projections at both regional and global scales.},

  abstract = {Understanding the climate change impacts on water and carbon cycles is of great importance for comprehensive watershed management. Although many studies have been conducted on the future climate change impacts on either water cycle or carbon cycle, the potential impacts on water-carbon coupling cycles are still poorly understood. This study used an integrated hydro-biochemical model (SWAT-DayCent) to quantitatively investigate the climate change impacts on water-carbon coupling cycles with a case study of typical loess hilly-gully watershed-the Jinghe River Basin (JRB) on the Loess Plateau. We used climate scenarios data derived under the three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) by five downscaled Global Circulation Models (GCMs) and set two future periods of 2020--2049 (near future, NF) and 2070--2099 (far future, FF). It was projected that the annual precipitation would generally decrease slightly during the NF period but increase by 4--11\% during the FF period, while the maximum/minimum air temperatures would increase significantly. The average annual streamflow would decrease (with up to 20.1\% under RCP8.5) and evapotranspiration (ET) would remain almost unchanged during the NF period; however, both of them would increase during the FF period. The net primary production (NPP) would be generally higher due to the CO2 fertilization, whereas the soil organic carbon would decrease across all scenarios due to the warmer climate. The NPP-ET was projected to be closely coupled across all scenarios, and this coupling was mainly controlled by the inter-annual variability (IAV) of precipitation. Moreover, the precipitation IAV combined with NPP-ET coupling could also jointly control the NPP variability in the JRB. These projections in water-carbon coupling cycles can be useful to make betterinformed decisions for future water resources and ecosystem management of the loess hilly-gully regions.},

The downscaled projections showed that the basin would be wetter at the annual scale during the next 80 years. Precipitation in spring would be increase over the entire basin under all future scenarios except SSP1-2.6. Parts of the PL basin exhibit drier trends under the four scenarios in summer, with the largest drying area occurring in the SSP2-4.5 scenario. Except in the SSP2-4.5 scenario, precipitation in autumn has increasing trends in all scenarios across the PL basin. Precipitation in winter shows a drying trend in some areas except in the SSP1-2.6 scenario, with the largest area occurring in SSP5-8.5. The results provide improved precipitation information for policy-making in water resource management and adaptation planning to mitigate Yangtze River floods in the future.},

We also predicted the distribution of land cover types in 2050 and 2070 using decision tree rules and climate scenarios, and then predicted SOC and TN pools of this region. The results suggested that the SOC and TN pools will decrease in the future.

  abstract = {Using the reconstructed continuous and homogenized surface air temperature (SAT) series for 16 cities across eastern China (where the greatest industrial developments in China have taken place) back to the nineteenth century, the authors examine linear trends of SAT. The regional-mean SAT over eastern China shows a warming trend of 1.528C (100 yr)21 during 1909--2010. It mainly occurred in the past 4 decades and this agrees well with the variability in another SAT series developed from a much denser station network (over 400 sites) across this part of China since 1951. This study collects population data for 245 sites (from these 4001 locations) and split these into five equally sized groups based on population size. Comparison of these five groups across different durations from 30 to 60 yr in length indicates that differences in population only account for between 9\% and 24\% of the warming since 1951. To show that a larger urbanization impact is very unlikely, the study additionally determines how much can be explained by some large-scale climate indices. Anomalies of large-scale climate indices such as the tropical Indian Ocean SST and the Siberian atmospheric circulation systems account for at least 80\% of the total warming trends.},

  abstract = {The Budyko parameter, which controls the shape of Budyko curve, represents the superimposed impact of various periodic factors (including climatic factors, catchment characteristics, large-scale climate patterns, solar activity and anthropogenic activity) on the watershed water-energy balance dynamics. However, this superimposition is not conducive to identifying the drivers of Budyko parameter dynamics at different time scales, and thus affects parameter estimation. Here we obtain the Budyko parameter omega in the Fu's equation (one form of the Budyko framework) for the Wei River Basin (WRB), and then adopt the Empirical Mode Decomposition method to reveal the relationships between factors and omega series at multiple time scales by considering the interplay among different influencing factors. Results indicate that (1) omega series are decomposed into 4-, 12-, 20-, exceeding 20-year time scale oscillations and a residual component with an significantly increasing trend in the mainstream of the WRB, a non-significantly decreasing trend in the Jing River Basin and Beiluo River Basin; (2) by analyzing the residual trend component, evaporation ratio, soil moisture and effective irrigated area are found to induce the significant increase of omega in the upstream of the WRB, whereas that in the middle and lower reaches is dominated by baseflow and Nino 3.4; (3) omega dynamics at the 4-year time scale is dominated by evaporation ratio, aridity index, baseflow and soil moisture; baseflow, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and sunspots attribute to the dynamics at 12-year time scale; all the factors except baseflow and soil moisture contribute to the dynamics at 20- or exceeding 20-year time scales. The results of this study will help identify the connection between watershed water-energy balance dynamics and changing environment at multiple time scales, and also be beneficial for guiding water resources management and ecological development planning on the Loess Plateau.

The concept of climate elasticity was used to assess the impacts of climate and land surface change on the streamflow. Results show that for the period 1960-2000 the elasticity of streamflow in relation to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are 2.10 and -1.04, respectively, indicating that streamflow is more sensitive to precipitation than to potential evapotranspiration. However, land use change played a more important role than climate in reducing streamflow in the 1990s. It is estimated that land use change is responsible for more than 70\% of the streamflow reduction in the 1990s, while climate change contributed to less than 30\% of the reduction. The precipitation elasticity appears to have an inverse relationship with the runoff coefficient but a positive relationship with the aridity index, showing that the drier the catchment, the more sensitive the streamflow with respect to precipitation change.},

  abstract = {The "Grain for Green" project (GGP) was launched in 1999 on China's Loess Plateau to reduce soil erosion, which had far-reaching impacts on the local eco-hydrological processes. In this study, we use monthly runoff depth and precipitation datasets spanning 1961 to 2015 for 16 primary basins of the plateau to reveal changes in runoff generation capacity before and after the GGP. We use a Budyko-based elasticity method to calculate the runoff depth (R-1) and runoff coefficient (C-1) exclusively attributable to land use/ cover change. Results indicate that the mean annual runoff coefficients (C-0) decline by 26\%-76\% from the periods 1961-1999 to 2000-2015. The annual observed runoff depth (R-0) and C-0 for 75\% of basins show significant downward trends during 1961-1999; after the implementation of the GGP, both annual R-0 and annual C-0 for over 50\% of basins show upward trends. The study further finds that the increase of erosive rainfall during the period 2000-2015, whose mean increasing rate reaches 4.6 mm/year, is the main reason for the upward trends of R-0 and C-0. After removing the effect of precipitation variation during this period, we find that 11 out of 16 basins show decreased trends for C-1, with the downward rate between 2.4\% and 6.0\% per year. The reduction rate in semi-arid areas is about four times the rate in semi-humid areas. The results remind us to consider the carrying capacity of local water resources when implementing soil and water conservation measures across the Loess Plateau.

Future climate projections simulated by five different global climate models (GCMs) individually and the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) distributed hydrological model coupled with a reservoir model are used to project the future hydropower outputs. Results present a generally ideal prospect for hydropower development in the UMB, as most GCMs illustrate overall increasing hydropower outputs of the plants along with the increasing reservoir inflow. The sustainability of the hydropower is also improved in most GCMs, with generally higher reliability and lower vulnerability; however, due to the large impact of increased climate variability, some GCMs show poorer sustainability for the hydropower plants in the future scenarios, even though its overall hydropower outputs are increased. Therefore, the negative influence of the increased variability of some passive GCM projections still indicates the risks for hydropower development in the TP and thus requires consideration. This study is expected to provide reference for further hydropower planning and development over the TP under climate change. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here, the trends and change points of streamflow were determined for the period 1956--2017 via five statistical methods. A runoff-sensitive coefficients method (the Budyko hypothesis) and a conceptual rainfall--runoff model (the TUW model) were applied to assess the streamflow variation. The following conclusions were ascertained: (1) 1989, 1986, and 1990 were the change points for streamflow in the upstream Tang-Nai-Hai and Lan-Zhou stations and the downstream Hua-Yuan-Kou hydrological station; (2) the streamflow showed statistically significant decreasing trends with spatiotemporal variations in the Yellow River Basin; (3) the relationship between runoff and precipitation showed a downward trend over time; (4) comparisons of the Budyko and TUW models show that human activity is responsible for more than 65\% of streamflow reduction, while climate change contributes to less than 35\% of the reduction. Therefore, human activity is the main reason for streamflow reduction in the Yellow River Basin. This finding is of critical importance for water resources management under changing environment.},

Analyzing and predicting drought characteristics and propagation are important for the early warning, prevention, and mitigation of drought disasters. This study used the precipitation and runoff outputs from General Circulation Models (GCMs) of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to evaluate the meteorological drought (MD) and hydrological drought (HD) characteristics in the Pearl River Basin (PRB) under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) (i.e., SSP24.5 and SSP5-8.5). The propagation characteristics of external propagation (response between different type of drought) and internal propagation (drought development and recovery stages of a single type of drought) were also comprehensively investigated based on CMIP6. The results revealed that: 1) the percentage of grids within the dry range of MD and HD will decrease from the historical period to the future period under the two scenarios. The PRB is projected to exhibit wetter patterns; 2) Higher emission scenarios (SSP5-8.5) are more likely to weaken dryness conditions; 3) regarding the external propagation, the drought response time from MD to HD would be 2 months, and there would be no significant change under two scenarios; and 4) regarding the internal propagation, during three study periods (1971-2010, 2021-2060 and 2061-2100), the MD (HD) average recovery time changed from 3.90 (3.36) to 3.75 (3.41) and then to 3.95 (3.43) months under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, and changed from 3.93 (3.46) to 3 (3.51) and then to 3.7 (3.25) months under the SSP5-8.5 scenario.

  abstract = {Increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration affect continental runoff through radiative and physiological forcing. However, how climate and land surface changes, and their interactions in particular, regulate changes in global runoff remains largely unresolved. Here we develop an attribution framework that integrates top-down empirical and bottom-up modelling approaches to show that land surface changes account for 73--81\% of projected global runoff increases. This arises from synergistic effects of physiological responses of vegetation to rising CO2 concentration and responses of land surface---for example, vegetation cover and soil moisture---to radiatively driven climate change. Although climate change strongly affects regional runoff changes, it plays a minor role (19--27\%) in the global runoff increase, due to cancellation of positive and negative contributions from different regions. Our findings highlight the importance of accurate model representation of land surface processes for reliable projections of global runoff to support sustainable management of water resources.},

  abstract = {The latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) proposes new shared pathways (SSPs) that incorporate socioeconomic development with more comprehensive and scientific experimental designs; however, few studies have been performed on the projection of future multibasin hydrological changes in China based on CMIP6 models. In this paper, we use the Equidistant Cumulative Distribution Function method (EDCDFm) to perform downscaling and bias correction in daily precipitation, daily maximum temperature, and daily minimum temperature for six CMIP6 models based on the historical gridded data from the high-resolution China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD). We use the bias-corrected precipitation, temperature, and daily mean wind speed to drive the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) hydrological model, and study the changes in multiyear average annual precipitation, annual evapotranspiration and total annual runoff depth relative to the historical baseline period (1985-2014) for the Chinese mainland, basins and grid scales in the 21st century future under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. The study shows that the VIC model accurately simulates runoff in major Chinese basins; the model data accuracy improves substantially after downscaling bias correction; and the future multimodel-mean multiyear average annual precipitation, annual evapotranspiration, and total annual runoff depth for the Chinese mainland and each basin increase relative to the historical period in near future (2020-2049) and far future (2070-2099) under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. The new CMIP6-based results of this paper can provide a strong reference for extreme event prevention, water resource utilization and management in China in the 21st century.},

However, the influence of land--atmosphere feedbacks on future P--E changes and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that soil moisture (SM) strongly impacts future P--E changes, especially in drylands, by regulating evapotranspiration and atmospheric moisture inflow. Using modelling and empirical approaches, we find a consistent negative SM feedback on P--E, which may offset {\textasciitilde}60\% of the decline in dryland P--E otherwise expected in the absence of SM feedbacks. The negative feedback is not caused by atmospheric thermodynamic responses to declining SM; rather, reduced SM, in addition to limiting evapotranspiration, regulates atmospheric circulation and vertical ascent to enhance moisture transport into drylands. This SM effect is a large source of uncertainty in projected dryland P--E changes, underscoring the need to better constrain future SM changes and improve the representation of SM--atmosphere processes in models.},

Focusing on four typical precipitation events includes: first, the combinations and mode structures of parameterization schemes of WRF suitable for simulating precipitation in the Jinshajiang River Basin were investigated. Then, the Xinanjiang model was established after calibration and validation to make up the hydro-meteorological system. It was found that the selection of the cloud microphysics scheme and boundary layer scheme has a great impact on precipitation simulation, and only a proper combination of the two schemes could yield accurate simulation effects in the Jinshajiang River Basin and the hydro-meteorological system can provide instructive flood forecasts with long lead time. On the whole, the one-way coupled hydro-meteorological model could be used for precipitation simulation and flood prediction in the Jinshajiang River Basin because of its relatively high precision and long lead time.},

In this study, based on Theil-Sen Median (TSM) and Mann-Kendall (M-K) methods, observational evidence from space was used to investigate the variation of snow parameters in China from 1979 to 2018, and some meaningful conclusions were found. (1) The downward trend of snow depth (SD) with a median of -0.02~cm/year was generally found in the high altitude mountains, and the upward trend of SD with a median of 0.01~cm/year occurs in the plains. A widespread and accelerated decrease of SD was observed in the latest period (2009--2018) in NC and NX. (2) The mean annual areas with snow cover days (SCDs) greater than 150~days (d) accounted for 17.8\%, 24.73\% and 38.14\% in NC, NX and QTP. SCDs in NC and Northern QTP were widely reduced, but the longest snow season with more than eight months is still maintained on QTP. (3) The downward trend of snow storage (SS) was found in all three snow areas. The difference of snow phenology is reflected in the slowest accumulation and melting rate of SS on QTP; the largest peak value of SS and the shortest snow season in NC; the slow accumulation and rapid melting of snow in the NX, and the peak value is achieved at the latest. The trend of maximum temperature was judged as the most important factor affecting the change of SD, while longitude and latitude are closely related to the change of SCD.},

Results show that the temperature sensitivity to precipitation during 2015--2100, which varies substantially in the original CMIP6 outputs, becomes systematically negative across SSPs after application of the EC, with absolute values between -1.10\,{$^\circ$}C mm-1 day and -3.52\,{$^\circ$}C mm-1 day, and with uncertainties reduced by 9.4\% to 41.4\%. The trend in tropical land-surface evapotranspiration, which was increasing by 0.292\,mm\,yr-1 in the original CMIP6 model outputs, becomes significantly negative (-0.469\,mm\,yr-1) after applying the constraint.

Observed annual snow cover fraction (SNF) has reduced over most areas by up to 2\%/decade, while annual snow cover area (SCA) has reduced by 2 x 10(5) km(2)/decade. However, SCA in the October-December season has increased by about 5 x 10(5) km(2)/decade. CMIP5 and CMIP6 historical experiments were validated against the NOAA-CDR data. Snow cover was generally well simulated in both CMIPs, with CMIP6 models performing better. The biases in SCA reduction were larger and smaller during summer and winter, respectively. The observed increase of October-November-December SCA in the 2000s was not reproduced. Climate projections of future snow cover were evaluated in CMIP6. SNF is projected to decrease in the next 80 years, under all four scenarios evaluated (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370 and SSP585). The higher the greenhouse emissions in the shared socio-economic pathways, the faster the reduction. Under the SSP585 scenario, the rate of SCA reduction is projected to exceed -1.2 x 10(6) km(2)/decade. By 2081-2100, annual (January-March) SCA is projected to decrease by more than 30\% (20\%). Under the SSP126 scenario, annual (January-March) SCA is projected to only reduce by about 10\% (5\%) relative 1995-2014 values. The reduction of Greenhouse gas emissions is critical to controlling the loss of snow cover; future snow cover only stabilizes under the SSP126 scenario, but continue to decrease under the other three scenarios.},

  abstract = {气候变化对不同生态系统的影响得到国际学者广泛研究。而水文循环是连接不同生态系统的重要环节。气候变化对水文循环过程的影响潜移默化地改变着人们和其他生物赖以生存的环境。近年来,气候变化导致的降水频率和降水量的增加,以及极端事件的频发越来越引起社会和学界的重视。在研究气候变化对水文水资源的影响时,存在着许多不同的不确定性来源。其中,降水作为水文过程模拟最重要的输入变量,其准确性对水文过程以及气候变化研究起着至关重要的决定作用。目前,遥感降水数据和再分析降水数据对水文模拟、预报和水资源管理有着极其重要的利用价值,且该价值对无资料地区而言尤为重要。本研究首先以地面站网实测数据为依据,评估了近两年新发布的以及另两种被广泛使用的全球高时空分辨率的降水数据PERSIANN-CDR,TRMM 3B42V7和NCEP-CFSR在中国湘江和衢州流域的准确度和可靠性。此外,结合SWAT水文模型,探讨了上述三种降水数据在水文径流模拟方面的适用性。在上述两个研究问题的基础上,利用PERSIANN-CDR具有的长时间序列（1983年-至今）,本研究首次将遥感降水数据与气候变化研究相结合探究了PERSIANN-CDR代替地面站点实测数据作为一种观测降水用于气候变化研究的适用性。除了降水这一重要因素外,水文模型参数的非平稳性和不确定性也是影响气候变化对水资源预测的另一重要因素。目前,很多与气候变化相关的研究在预测未来水资源时所使用的水文模型参数都是通过历史时期数据率定得到,即假定参数是平稳的。但气候变化导致的水文模型参数的非平稳性和不确定性对该假设的可靠性提出了挑战。目前,很少有研究将水文模型参数在时间上的非平稳性和不确定性联合起来探究它们对气候变化下水文水资源的影响。本研究针对该问题,通过选取代表湿润、平均和干旱三种不同气候条件的率定时期,并以基准期这一率定时期作为对照组,探究了参数的非平稳性对气候变化研究的影响。本研究除使用传统的单次最优模拟法外,还提出了 k-模拟法。通过对比分析这两种方法来研究参数的不确定性问题对未来水资源预测的影响。本研究的主要工作和主要结论如下:（1）以地面实测降水数据为依据,使用四个评估降水产品时间序列和地面站点实测降水序列拟合情况的指标（相关系数CC、平均均方根误差RMSE、平均误差ME和相对误差BIAS）及三个评估降水事件准确度的指标（POD、FAR和CSI）,在不同时空尺度（时间:日、月尺度;空间:子流域和整个流域）上评估了湘江和衢州流域上TRMM 3B42V7、PERSIANN-CDR和NCEP-CFSR三种降水数据。结果表明,TRMM3B42V7在月尺度上相关系数最大且误差最小,因此表现最优;PERSIANN-CDR表现次之;NCEP-CFSR表现最差。（2）在基于SWAT模型的水文模拟方面,PERSIANN-CDR和3B42V7不论是在日尺度还是月尺度,均表现出较好的径流模拟能力,但NCEP-CFSR在不同流域上表现不一致,波动较大。相较而言,3B42V7在逐日径流模拟方面表现最优,PERSIANN-CDR模拟的径流表现出高水被低估的现象,而NCEP-CFSR模拟的径流与PERSIANN-CDR正好相反,其高水被严重高估。在极端事件（最大日、最大三日和最大五日降水/径流）方面,PERSIANN-CDR低估了降水极值,同时其模拟的径流极值也被低估。NCEP-CFSR与PERSIANN-CDR表现正好相反。（3）比较评估PERSIANN-CDR和16个全球气候模式CMIP5的降水估计和径流模拟两方面的表现,尤其分析了其在降水和径流极端事件方面的表现。结果表明,PERSIANN-CDR在气候变化研究领域有很大的价值,特别是在极端降水事件方面。CMIP5模式的降水估计和降水极值在使用PERSIANN-CDR偏差纠正后均得到了很大的改善。对于PERSIANN-CDR对CMIP5降水估计的偏差纠正对径流模拟的影响,结果显示16个模式中有11个模式的径流模拟因为其降水经PERSIANN-CDR偏差纠正得到了改善。在径流极值方面,PERSIANN-CDR对CMIP5降水估计偏差纠正的作用并不稳定,16个模式中只有8个模式降水模拟的径流极值因为其降水的偏差纠正得到了改善。（4）对参数的可移植性和不确定性的研究结果表明,率定期为湿润时期时率定得到的参数移植到研究时期（验证期或未来时期）也是湿润气候条件时表现最好。而当研究时期为干旱气候条件时,率定期为基准期时,模型模拟效果最优。对于未来时期（2011-2040）的逐日高水而言,率定期为干旱时期时不确定性最大,而逐日中水和低水的最大不确定性源于率定期为平均时期得到的参数组。对于未来时期（2011-2040）的年径流而言,最大的不确定性是率定期为平均时期对应的模拟结果,其次是率定期为湿润时期的模拟结果,干旱时期为率定期时模拟的年径流不确定性最小。此外,结果还表明,率定期为湿润和平均时期时最优目标函数对应的参数模拟出的季径流相较于k-模拟法模拟的季径流而言偏低,而率定期为基准期时基本高于k-模拟法模拟的季径流。相较而言,k-模拟法可以降低水资源管理中由于高估或低估而存在的风险。},

  abstract = {Payment for ecosystem services (PES) is of great importance for the sustainable development of mountain areas, key hotspot regions for the provisioning of ecosystem services. At present, PES researches mainly focus on forest protection, carbon sink trading, and water protection. As an important industry in mountainous areas, cascade hydropower development has generated substantial economic benefits accompanied by social and ecological impacts. However, efficient PES mechanisms to deal with hydropower generation in mountain areas are still unavailable. Therefore, the lacking of PES in mountain systems limits the development of those areas, and compromise the sustainability of hydropower development. The critical reason lies in the lack of a scientific method that can quantitatively analyze the relationship of hydropower stations with a geographical scope at county level (i.e., quantifying the water yield service provided by each county within the cascade hydropower development basin), and with different hydropower enterprises. We use the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin of China as case study area, one of the major hydropower development basins in China. First, we used Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model to map water yield service. Then, we calculated the value of water yield service by relating the water yield to the gross output value of hydropower stations. We revealed the relationship (e.g., hydropower stations and identified counties) between the payers and the payees of ecosystem services through mapping and quantifying the provisioning regions in the supply of water yield service and the users (hydropower enterprises). Finally, we discussed the current situation of benefit distribution in cascade hydropower development basin based on the supply and use of the water yield service. The results showed that 1) the spatial distribution of the value of water yield service is uneven: the upper reaches are high-value areas; the eastern region is higher than the western region; and the maximum value (USD 119.2 \$/km(2)) is 34 times higher than the minimum value (USD 3.5 \$/km(2)). 2) We found that four state-owned enterprises are the direct beneficiaries of water yield service, and 37 counties are suppliers, among which Gongbogyamda, Lhari and Damxung are the first level of supply. 3) Each hydropower station is provided with water yield service by several counties, and the value of water yield service varies greatly in each county, showing spatial differences. 4) Most counties are only partially involved in the process of water yield service being used by hydropower stations (i.e., the boundary of water yield service is inconsistent with the administrative boundary). 5) Huaneng Tibet Yarlung Zangbo River Hydropower Development and Investment Co., Ltd. gets the greatest value (USD 1.8 million \$) from the use of water yield service, while China Energy Tibet Electric Power Co., Ltd. gets the smallest (USD 389.1 thousand \$). 6) Counties near the lower reaches have gained more economic benefits, while the water yield service they provide have the lowest contribution to hydropower production. Our approach linked water yield ecosystem service and hydropower development effectively, and revealed their complex eco-economic relationship between producers and beneficiaries of ecosystem services, which provides key insights for the designing of a potential PES mechanism.},

  abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has the largest areas of permafrost terrain in the mid-and low-latitude regions of the world. Some permafrost distribution maps have been compiled but, due to limited data sources, ambiguous criteria, inadequate validation, and deficiency of high-quality spatial data sets, there is high uncertainty in the mapping of the permafrost distribution on the TP. We generated a new permafrost map based on freezing and thawing indices from modified Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperatures (LSTs) and validated this map using various ground-based data sets. The soil thermal properties of five soil types across the TP were estimated according to an empirical equation and soil properties (moisture content and bulk density). The temperature at the top of permafrost (TTOP) model was applied to simulate the permafrost distribution. Permafrost, seasonally frozen ground, and unfrozen ground covered areas of 1.06 x 10(6) km(2) (0.97-1.15 x 10(6) km(2), 90\% confidence interval) (40 \%), 1.46 x 10(6) (56 \%), and 0.03 x 10(6) km(2) (1 \%), respectively, excluding glaciers and lakes. Ground-based observations of the permafrost distribution across the five investigated regions (IRs, located in the transition zones of the permafrost and seasonally frozen ground) and three highway transects (across the entire permafrost regions from north to south) were used to validate the model. Validation results showed that the kappa coefficient varied from 0.38 to 0.78 with a mean of 0.57 for the five IRs and 0.62 to 0.74 with a mean of 0.68 within the three transects. Compared with earlier studies, the TTOP modelling results show greater accuracy. The results provide more detailed information on the permafrost distribution and basic data for use in future research on the Tibetan Plateau permafrost.},

  abstract = {Precipitation directly affects the socioeconomic development in the inland river basins of the arid regions of Northwest China. However, the scarcity of observed data makes it hard to adequately investigate precipitation changes. To help solve this problem, we evaluated the precipitation patterns and trends of 19 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) in the northern mountains, central basin, and southern mountains of the Tarim River Basin based on observed data from 1965 to 2014, and conducted a comparison with CMIP5. The results showed that the CMIP6 models have spatial differences in capturing the monthly precipitation over the Tarim River Basin. Although it can capture the changes in monthly precipitation of mountains and basins, it does not capture the monthly maximum precipitation in mountains quite well. CMIP6 models capture precipitation with greater deviations in the wet season than in the dry season, especially for the peak precipitation in June and July. Underestimation of annual precipitation in the northern mountains is common in CMIP6 models with the RMSE of 42.51-50.55 mm. Most models capture the wetting trends in the southern mountains, but their reproduction of wetting trends in the northern mountains differs significantly in coverage. The change rates of annual precipitation from 2015 to 2100 in the northern mountains, central basin, and southern mountains under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 are 0.20-0.29 mm/a, 0.10-0.18 mm/a, and 0.23-0.49 mm/a, respectively. The wetting trend in the Tarim River Basin is significantly higher under SSP5-8.5 than under SSP2-4.5. The comparison between CMIP5 and CMIP6 indicates that CMIP6 models are generally able to capture its fluctuating characteristics. However, there is no single model that can simultaneously represent the observed precipitation changes in the Tarim River Basin, especially for the differences in basins and mountains.},
